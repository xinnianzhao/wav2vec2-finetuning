5849-50873-0000 CAPTAIN BULL THE COMMANDER OF A SMALL GARRISON AT SAYBROOK PERMITTED HIM TO LAND BUT WHEN THE GOVERNOR BEGAN TO READ HIS COMMISSION BULL ORDERED HIM TO BE SILENT
5849-50873-0001 WHAT HAS HAPPENED MISTER PRINCE WADSWORTH ASKED FOR HE COULD SEE THAT THE MAN WAS GREATLY EXCITED GOVERNOR ANDROS HAS COME AGAIN GASPED MISTER PRINCE WHY SHOULD THAT ALARM US THE FELLOW THOUGH GIVEN TO BOASTING IS NOT DANGEROUS OR LIABLE TO PUT HIS THREATS INTO EXECUTION BUT HE HAS GROWN DANGEROUS DECLARED MISTER PRINCE THE LIBERTIES OF THE COLONY ARE INVOLVED
5849-50873-0002 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BECAME A LITTLE UNEASY THOUGH HE WAS STILL INCLINED TO TREAT THE MATTER LIGHTLY
5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR IT IS THE GUARDIAN OF OUR POLITICAL RIGHTS
5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNNESS THIS VICEROY HAS COME TO HARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF THE CHARTER IN PERSON
5849-50873-0005 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BOUNDED TO HIS FEET IN A RAGE AND PLACING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD DECLARED HE SHALL NOT HAVE IT
5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NIGH SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE MEMBERS WERE ENGAGED IN A HEATED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO AWAIT THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0008 AFTER THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE TURNS ACROSS THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND ASKED
5849-50873-0009 WHAT IS THE ASSEMBLY DOING ENGAGED IN A DEBATE
5849-50873-0010 AND WILL HE WAIT UNTIL IT HAS ENDED HE HAS PROMISED TO DO SO
5849-50873-0011 MISTER PRINCE FIXED HIS AMAZED EYES ON THE CAPTAIN'S FACE AND READ THERE A DESPERATE DETERMINATION CAPTAIN HE BEGAN
5849-50873-0012 MISTER PRINCE BOWED AND HASTILY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE THE ASSEMBLY WAS IN SESSION
5849-50873-0013 AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE CHARLES STEVENS SAID
5849-50873-0014 YES CHARLES YOU WILL ANSWER WHAT DO YOU MEAN UNCLE
5849-50873-0015 NEVER DID DEBATERS TAKE GREATER INTEREST IN A MINOR SUBJECT
5849-50873-0016 WHAT DO YOU INTEND DOING UNCLE WILL YOU FIGHT THEM
5849-50873-0017 REMEMBER THE WORK MUST BE DONE RIGHT AT THE TIME NOT TOO SOON NOR TOO LATE
5849-50873-0018 THE SUN WAS SETTING AND THE CAPTAIN SAID
5849-50873-0019 COME CHARLES LET US HASTEN TO THE ASSEMBLY
5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS BUT I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR MISSION
5849-50873-0021 TAKE YOUR PLACE CHARLES AND BE PREPARED TO DO YOUR PART WHISPERED CAPTAIN WADSWORTH
5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GOT AS CLOSE TO THE LONG TABLE USED BY THE SECRETARIES AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING SPECIAL ATTENTION
5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE AND TWO SET ON A SHELF ON THE WALL
5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO CANDLES ON THE WALL WERE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL HE SAW A MAN STATIONED NEAR THEM
5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE WINDOWS THE FAINT STARLIGHT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
5849-50873-0026 HE FOLLOWED HIM AS RAPIDLY AS HE COULD
5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE SEIZED HIS ARM
5849-50873-0028 BOY HAVE A CARE HOW YOU APPROACH ME
5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN WADSWORTH THE TRAIN BANDS CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOLDIERS
5849-50873-0030 WHERE IS THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0031 YOU HAVE YOUR SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR AND WE HAVE THE TRAIN BANDS OF CONNECTICUT READY TO DEFEND US AGAINST VIOLENCE
5849-50873-0032 WHO OF YOU HAS THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0033 IT WAS THE BOY CRIED THE ENRAGED GOVERNOR
5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY SHOOK THEIR HEADS
5849-50873-0035 WE DO NOT KNOW HIM HE DOES NOT LIVE IN CONNECTICUT WHERE DOES HE LIVE
5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFUL ASSISTANT DREAM THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THE OLD TREE HISTORIC
5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THE DOCUMENT WAS HIDDEN WAS EVER AFTERWARD KNOWN AS THE CHARTER OAK
5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED VIGOROUS BEARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF WIND
5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER FOR THE SEIZURE OF THE CHARTERS WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN THE ASSEMBLY OF RHODE ISLAND SENT A MOST LOYAL ADDRESS TO THE KING SAYING
5849-50873-0040 HE FORMALLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE ADMITTED FIVE OF THE INHABITANTS INTO HIS LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE ENFORCED UNION OF THE COLONIES FOR MUTUAL DEFENCE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF RHODE ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENSIVE EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THE FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMENED CLOUD
5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAM'S WAR SOON AFTER TO THE EXPULSION OF ANDROS
