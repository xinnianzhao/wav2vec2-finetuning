7697-245712-0000 FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD DISOBEYED NOTHING DISOBEYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH ALWAYS GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
7697-245712-0004 THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OF OTHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PARTICIPATED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MAN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT ARE THEY FOR THAT REASON EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED THE ANIMALS TO MAN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE OBEYED MAN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD IT HAVE OBEYED MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY HIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DOMINION OVER PLANTS
7697-245712-0013 NOW IN MAN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HAVE BEEN STERILE
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITY
7697-245712-0016 INEQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE ON THE PART OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS
