8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT I SAID
8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESS
8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENSE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAT A MAN CAN INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE
8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO CRUELLY TO ME SHE ASKED
8173-294714-0008 YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IN SECRET IS ALL YOURS
8173-294714-0009 WHAT WRONG ARE YOU TALKING OF
8173-294714-0010 IS IT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING STILL
8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS THE CHILD PRIDE SHE REPEATED
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS MINE
8173-294714-0016 A HELPLESS WOMAN WITH A MOCK HUSBAND IN PRISON FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FOOD AND SHELTER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
8173-294714-0019 BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY
8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
8173-294714-0023 OH WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF
8173-294714-0024 HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SPEAK OF IT
8173-294714-0025 I YIELDED AND SPOKE OF IT NO MORE
8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INFATUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SAID
8173-294714-0029 LET ME DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN
8173-294714-0030 IT IS SOMETHING TO BE YOUR ONLY FRIEND
8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW I CAN HELP YOU
8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HEALTH
8173-294714-0033 MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED WHAT DO YOU MEAN
8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VAN BRANDT
8173-294714-0036 DOES SPEAKING OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 WHY NEED YOU HESITATE
8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR ANXIETIES
8173-294714-0039 NEVER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH
8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR HIS GETTING OUT OF PRISON
8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOUR WORDS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE VAN BRANDT A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
8173-294714-0046 THANKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION THE ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFER TO LEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS THE MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT
8173-294714-0048 YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN I REPLIED
8173-294714-0049 I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN BRANDT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW MONEY ON YOUR POLICY OF INSURANCE
8173-294714-0051 I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SADLY
8173-294714-0052 WILL YOU LET ME ASK THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYERS
8173-294714-0053 THEY ARE TRUSTWORTHY AND EXPERIENCED MEN AND I AM SURE THEY CAN BE OF USE TO YOU
8173-294714-0054 CAUTIOUSLY AS I HAD EXPRESSED MYSELF HER DELICACY TOOK THE ALARM
8173-294714-0055 PROMISE THAT YOU WON'T ASK ME TO BORROW MONEY OF YOU FOR MISTER VAN BRANDT SHE REJOINED AND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR HELP GRATEFULLY
8173-294714-0056 I COULD HONESTLY PROMISE THAT
8173-294714-0057 MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HER LAY IN KEEPING FROM HER KNOWLEDGE THE COURSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINED TO PURSUE
8173-294714-0058 I ROSE TO GO WHILE MY RESOLUTION STILL SUSTAINED ME
8173-294714-0059 KISS ME SHE WHISPERED BEFORE YOU GO
8173-294714-0060 IT IS ONLY YOUR GOODNESS THAT OVERPOWERS ME
