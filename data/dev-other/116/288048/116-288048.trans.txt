116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DATES WERE OBSERVED BY THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AT VARIOUS TIMES AS THE BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GOSPELS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEAR TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 WHY THIS DISCREPANCY IN A HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARY AND JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED INTO EGYPT LUKE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COME TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS ABOUT JESUS WE MEET WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 WHILE IT IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUCIFIXION IS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUINOX AS THE FULL MOON ALLOWS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAC AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PAGAN OESTERA HAS BECOME THE CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE ORIGIN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE SCEPTICAL CELSUS ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MYTHUS OF JESUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW WHO WAS MARK
116-288048-0012 WHO WERE JOHN PETER JUDAS AND MARY
116-288048-0013 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCTRINE HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF A MYTH
116-288048-0016 HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 COULD THEY HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 HOW ELSE IS THIS UNANIMOUS SILENCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOTES
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BY THE SWORD NOW AND BY HELL FIRE HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JESUS MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE TO COURTIERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TODAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE THESE PRAYERS BEEN ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF DELUDED PROPHETS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH THE PREACHERS OF TODAY GIVE HE PARRIED HIS ANSWER WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS TO BE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF YE ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT MEAN JUST WHAT HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS THE REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
