1630-73710-0000 IT IS AT THE FOOT OF WOMAN THAT WE LAY THE LAURELS THAT WITHOUT HER SMILE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GAINED IT IS HER IMAGE THAT STRINGS THE LYRE OF THE POET THAT ANIMATES OUR VOICE IN THE BLAZE OF ELOQUENT FACTION AND GUIDES OUR BRAIN IN THE AUGUST TOILS OF STATELY COUNCILS
1630-73710-0001 IS THERE NO HOPE FOR THEM SO FULL OF HOPE
1630-73710-0002 IT MAKES THE HEART ACHE BUT TO PICTURE SUCH VICISSITUDES TO THE IMAGINATION
1630-73710-0003 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH CHANGES CAN OCCUR FLITS OVER THE MIND LIKE THE THOUGHT OF DEATH OBSCURING ALL OUR GAY FANCIES WITH ITS BAT LIKE WING AND TAINTING THE HEALTHY ATMOSPHERE OF OUR HAPPINESS WITH ITS VENOMOUS EXPIRATIONS
1630-73710-0004 MINE OWN
1630-73710-0005 WHAT DID WHAT COULD YOU DO
1630-73710-0006 I BEAT ABOUT MY CHAMBER LIKE A SILLY BIRD IN A CAGE
1630-73710-0007 DO NOT THINK OF MOVING TO DAY
1630-73710-0008 DO NOT KEEP THE MESSENGER AN INSTANT
1630-73710-0009 HE IS ON MY PONY
1630-73710-0010 WRITE ONLY ONE WORD TO YOUR OWN HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0011 FERDINAND TO HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0012 GOD BLESS YOU MY HENRIETTA MY BELOVED MY MATCHLESS HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0013 WHAT HAS THAT SEPARATION NOT COST ME
1630-73710-0014 PANGS THAT I COULD NOT CONCEIVE ANY HUMAN MISERY COULD OCCASION
1630-73710-0015 AND YET I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT HE WAS UNINJURED LAST NIGHT
1630-73710-0016 I DARE NOT NOW OWN HOW FOOLISH I WAS
1630-73710-0017 DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH YOUR HENRIETTA BUT I AM NERVOUS ABOUT CONCEALING OUR ENGAGEMENT FROM PAPA
1630-73710-0018 DAYS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE YOU CAN REACH BATH AND I KNOW FERDINAND I KNOW YOUR OFFICE IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU WILL CONFESS
1630-73710-0019 BUT COME BACK MY OWN AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND WRITE TO ME AT THE POST OFFICE AS YOU SETTLED
1630-73710-0020 THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT YOU ARE SO NEAR MAKES ME RESTLESS
1630-73710-0021 I WISH TO MEET HIM WITH AS MUCH CALMNESS AS I CAN COMMAND
