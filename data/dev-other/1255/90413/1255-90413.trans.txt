1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINE AVON'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART AWHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL
1255-90413-0004 BUT WAS HE ABLE
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL PULL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN THE CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD AIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES O NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER UNCIVIL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANNELCLIFFE'S THE OTHER NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOCELYN PIERSTON
1255-90413-0019 O DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINE AVON WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 BUT JOCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY IRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICHOLA PINE AVON
1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL
1255-90413-0024 AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATE FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
