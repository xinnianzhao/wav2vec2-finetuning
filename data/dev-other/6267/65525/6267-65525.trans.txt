6267-65525-0000 AS SHE SLIPPED INTO HER BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNT CALLED TO HER FROM BELOW
6267-65525-0001 AUNT JANE WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WITH A LAMP IN ONE HAND AND A YEAR OLD BABY CLINGING TO THE OTHER
6267-65525-0002 SHE WAS A BIG SHAPELESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURED FACE CHEERFUL AND VULGAR AS A SUNFLOWER WAS AUNT JANE AT ALL TIMES AND OCCASIONS
6267-65525-0003 I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISSUS BRIXBY IS THIS EVENING SIDDY AND YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THE BABY TILL I GET BACK
6267-65525-0004 SIDNEY SIGHED AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS FOR THE BABY
6267-65525-0005 ALL HER DAYS WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULLNESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED THEM CHEERFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY
6267-65525-0006 BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHEN SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTER
6267-65525-0007 THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MERE BOX ABOVE THE KITCHEN WHICH SIDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS
6267-65525-0008 HER BED AND THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRLS SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE
6267-65525-0009 JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR ANGLE ONE EYE APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS AN ORANGE WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE SIZE OF A PEA AND THE MOUTH ZIGZAGGED FROM EAR TO EAR
6267-65525-0010 SIDNEY HATED THAT MIRROR AS VIRULENTLY AS SHE COULD HATE ANYTHING
6267-65525-0011 HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND SIDNEY THEREUPON HAD COME INTO THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT JANE WITH THOSE BOOKS FOR HER DOWRY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXPENSES OF THE DOUBLE FUNERAL HAD BEEN PAID

6267-65525-0018 SIDNEY LIKED THE LETTER AND ANSWERED IT
6267-65525-0019 SHE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET JOHN LINCOLN NOR DID SHE WISH TO DO SO
