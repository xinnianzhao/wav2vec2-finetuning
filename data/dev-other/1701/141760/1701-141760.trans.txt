1701-141760-0000 THE PAVLOGRADS HELD FEAST AFTER FEAST CELEBRATING AWARDS THEY HAD RECEIVED FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND MADE EXPEDITIONS TO OLMUTZ TO VISIT A CERTAIN CAROLINE THE HUNGARIAN WHO HAD RECENTLY OPENED A RESTAURANT THERE WITH GIRLS AS WAITRESSES
1701-141760-0001 THE GUARDS HAD MADE THEIR WHOLE MARCH AS IF ON A PLEASURE TRIP PARADING THEIR CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE
1701-141760-0002 THE REGIMENTS HAD ENTERED AND LEFT THE TOWN WITH THEIR BANDS PLAYING AND BY THE GRAND DUKE'S ORDERS THE MEN HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY IN STEP A PRACTICE ON WHICH THE GUARDS PRIDED THEMSELVES THE OFFICERS ON FOOT AND AT THEIR PROPER POSTS
1701-141760-0003 BORIS HAD BEEN QUARTERED AND HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY WITH BERG WHO WAS ALREADY IN COMMAND OF A COMPANY
1701-141760-0004 BORIS DURING THE CAMPAIGN HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MANY PERSONS WHO MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO HIM AND BY A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION HE HAD BROUGHT FROM PIERRE HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI THROUGH WHOM HE HOPED TO OBTAIN A POST ON THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF'S STAFF
1701-141760-0005 BERG AND BORIS HAVING RESTED AFTER YESTERDAY'S MARCH WERE SITTING CLEAN AND NEATLY DRESSED AT A ROUND TABLE IN THE CLEAN QUARTERS ALLOTTED TO THEM PLAYING CHESS
1701-141760-0006 WELL HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT OF THAT HE REMARKED
1701-141760-0007 AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR OPENED
1701-141760-0008 DEAR ME HOW YOU HAVE CHANGED
1701-141760-0009 HE WAS ABOUT TO EMBRACE HIS FRIEND BUT NICHOLAS AVOIDED HIM
1701-141760-0010 HE WANTED TO PINCH HIM PUSH HIM DO ANYTHING BUT KISS HIM A THING EVERYBODY DID
1701-141760-0011 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS BORIS EMBRACED HIM IN A QUIET FRIENDLY WAY AND KISSED HIM THREE TIMES
1701-141760-0012 THEY HAD NOT MET FOR NEARLY HALF A YEAR AND BEING AT THE AGE WHEN YOUNG MEN TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS ON LIFE'S ROAD EACH SAW IMMENSE CHANGES IN THE OTHER QUITE A NEW REFLECTION OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN THOSE FIRST STEPS
1701-141760-0013 I DID NOT EXPECT YOU TODAY HE ADDED
1701-141760-0014 YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT HIS IMPERIAL HIGHNESS RODE WITH OUR REGIMENT ALL THE TIME SO THAT WE HAD EVERY COMFORT AND EVERY ADVANTAGE
1701-141760-0015 WHAT RECEPTIONS WE HAD IN POLAND
1701-141760-0016 WHAT DINNERS AND BALLS I CAN'T TELL YOU
1701-141760-0017 OH YOU GUARDS SAID ROSTOV I SAY SEND FOR SOME WINE
1701-141760-0018 HE WENT TO HIS BED DREW A PURSE FROM UNDER THE CLEAN PILLOW AND SENT FOR WINE
1701-141760-0019 YES AND I HAVE SOME MONEY AND A LETTER TO GIVE YOU HE ADDED
1701-141760-0020 OH DON'T MENTION IT COUNT I QUITE UNDERSTAND SAID BERG GETTING UP AND SPEAKING IN A MUFFLED AND GUTTURAL VOICE
1701-141760-0021 GO ACROSS TO OUR HOSTS THEY INVITED YOU ADDED BORIS
1701-141760-0022 BERG PUT ON THE CLEANEST OF COATS WITHOUT A SPOT OR SPECK OF DUST STOOD BEFORE A LOOKING GLASS AND BRUSHED THE HAIR ON HIS TEMPLES UPWARDS IN THE WAY AFFECTED BY THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER AND HAVING ASSURED HIMSELF FROM THE WAY ROSTOV LOOKED AT IT THAT HIS COAT HAD BEEN NOTICED LEFT THE ROOM WITH A PLEASANT SMILE
1701-141760-0023 OH DEAR WHAT A BEAST I AM MUTTERED ROSTOV AS HE READ THE LETTER WHY
1701-141760-0024 WELL HAVE YOU SENT GABRIEL FOR SOME WINE ALL RIGHT LET'S HAVE SOME
1701-141760-0025 IN THE LETTER FROM HIS PARENTS WAS ENCLOSED A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION TO BAGRATION WHICH THE OLD COUNTESS AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S ADVICE HAD OBTAINED THROUGH AN ACQUAINTANCE AND SENT TO HER SON ASKING HIM TO TAKE IT TO ITS DESTINATION AND MAKE USE OF IT
1701-141760-0026 WHY HAVE YOU THROWN THAT AWAY ASKED BORIS
1701-141760-0027 IT IS SOME LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION WHAT THE DEVIL DO I WANT IT FOR
1701-141760-0028 HE LOOKED INTENTLY AND INQUIRINGLY INTO HIS FRIEND'S EYES EVIDENTLY TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND THE ANSWER TO SOME QUESTION
1701-141760-0029 WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT COUNT I WAS NOT AT ALL ALARMED BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS RIGHT
1701-141760-0030 I CAME FORWARD BERG STOOD UP AND SHOWED HOW HE PRESENTED HIMSELF WITH HIS HAND TO HIS CAP AND REALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR A FACE TO EXPRESS GREATER RESPECT AND SELF COMPLACENCY THAN HIS DID
1701-141760-0031 WELL HE STORMED AT ME AS THE SAYING IS STORMED AND STORMED AND STORMED
1701-141760-0032 IT WAS NOT A MATTER OF LIFE BUT RATHER OF DEATH AS THE SAYING IS
1701-141760-0033 ALBANIANS AND DEVILS AND TO SIBERIA SAID BERG WITH A SAGACIOUS SMILE
1701-141760-0034 STILL I REMAINED SILENT AND WHAT DO YOU THINK COUNT
1701-141760-0035 THE NEXT DAY IT WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THE ORDERS OF THE DAY
1701-141760-0036 THAT'S THE WAY COUNT SAID BERG LIGHTING HIS PIPE AND EMITTING RINGS OF SMOKE
1701-141760-0037 YES THAT WAS FINE SAID ROSTOV SMILING
1701-141760-0038 ROSTOV WAS A TRUTHFUL YOUNG MAN AND WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT HAVE TOLD A DELIBERATE LIE
1701-141760-0039 HE BEGAN HIS STORY MEANING TO TELL EVERYTHING JUST AS IT HAPPENED BUT IMPERCEPTIBLY INVOLUNTARILY AND INEVITABLY HE LAPSED INTO FALSEHOOD
1701-141760-0040 PRINCE ANDREW WHO LIKED TO HELP YOUNG MEN WAS FLATTERED BY BEING ASKED FOR HIS ASSISTANCE AND BEING WELL DISPOSED TOWARD BORIS WHO HAD MANAGED TO PLEASE HIM THE DAY BEFORE HE WISHED TO DO WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WANTED
1701-141760-0041 IN SPITE OF PRINCE ANDREW'S DISAGREEABLE IRONICAL TONE IN SPITE OF THE CONTEMPT WITH WHICH ROSTOV FROM HIS FIGHTING ARMY POINT OF VIEW REGARDED ALL THESE LITTLE ADJUTANTS ON THE STAFF OF WHOM THE NEWCOMER WAS EVIDENTLY ONE ROSTOV FELT CONFUSED BLUSHED AND BECAME SILENT
1701-141760-0042 BORIS INQUIRED WHAT NEWS THERE MIGHT BE ON THE STAFF AND WHAT WITHOUT INDISCRETION ONE MIGHT ASK ABOUT OUR PLANS
1701-141760-0043 WE SHALL PROBABLY ADVANCE REPLIED BOLKONSKI EVIDENTLY RELUCTANT TO SAY MORE IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGER
1701-141760-0044 BERG TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK WITH GREAT POLITENESS WHETHER AS WAS RUMORED THE ALLOWANCE OF FORAGE MONEY TO CAPTAINS OF COMPANIES WOULD BE DOUBLED
1701-141760-0045 I WAS THERE SAID ROSTOV ANGRILY AS IF INTENDING TO INSULT THE AIDE DE CAMP
1701-141760-0046 WITH A SLIGHTLY CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE HE SAID YES THERE ARE MANY STORIES NOW TOLD ABOUT THAT AFFAIR
1701-141760-0047 BUT OUR STORIES ARE THE STORIES OF MEN WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER THE ENEMY'S FIRE
1701-141760-0048 OUR STORIES HAVE SOME WEIGHT NOT LIKE THE STORIES OF THOSE FELLOWS ON THE STAFF WHO GET REWARDS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING
1701-141760-0049 HOWEVER HE ADDED RISING YOU KNOW MY NAME AND WHERE TO FIND ME BUT DON'T FORGET THAT I DO NOT REGARD EITHER MYSELF OR YOU AS HAVING BEEN AT ALL INSULTED AND AS A MAN OLDER THAN YOU MY ADVICE IS TO LET THE MATTER DROP
1701-141760-0050 EXCLAIMED PRINCE ANDREW AND WITH A BOW TO THEM BOTH HE WENT OUT
1701-141760-0051 AND HE WAS STILL MORE ANGRY AT HAVING OMITTED TO SAY IT
1701-141760-0052 HE ORDERED HIS HORSE AT ONCE AND COLDLY TAKING LEAVE OF BORIS RODE HOME
1701-141760-0053 SHOULD HE GO TO HEADQUARTERS NEXT DAY AND CHALLENGE THAT AFFECTED ADJUTANT OR REALLY LET THE MATTER DROP WAS THE QUESTION THAT WORRIED HIM ALL THE WAY
