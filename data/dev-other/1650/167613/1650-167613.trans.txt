1650-167613-0000 THE OFFICERS WERE ABOUT TO TAKE LEAVE BUT PRINCE ANDREW APPARENTLY RELUCTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS FRIEND ASKED THEM TO STAY AND HAVE TEA
1650-167613-0001 SEATS WERE BROUGHT IN AND SO WAS THE TEA
1650-167613-0002 THE OFFICERS GAZED WITH SURPRISE AT PIERRE'S HUGE STOUT FIGURE AND LISTENED TO HIS TALK OF MOSCOW AND THE POSITION OF OUR ARMY ROUND WHICH HE HAD RIDDEN
1650-167613-0003 SO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE POSITION OF OUR TROOPS
1650-167613-0004 NOT BEING A MILITARY MAN I CAN'T SAY I HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT FULLY BUT I UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL POSITION
1650-167613-0005 WELL THEN YOU KNOW MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE BE IT WHO IT MAY SAID PRINCE ANDREW
1650-167613-0006 AND TELL ME YOUR OPINION OF BARCLAY DE TOLLY
1650-167613-0007 PIERRE LOOKED AT TIMOKHIN WITH THE CONDESCENDINGLY INTERROGATIVE SMILE WITH WHICH EVERYBODY INVOLUNTARILY ADDRESSED THAT OFFICER
1650-167613-0008 WE SEE LIGHT AGAIN SINCE HIS SERENITY HAS BEEN APPOINTED YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID TIMOKHIN TIMIDLY AND CONTINUALLY TURNING TO GLANCE AT HIS COLONEL
1650-167613-0009 WHY SO ASKED PIERRE
1650-167613-0010 THEN WHY WAS IT FORBIDDEN
1650-167613-0011 AT SMOLENSK TOO HE JUDGED CORRECTLY THAT THE FRENCH MIGHT OUTFLANK US AS THEY HAD LARGER FORCES
1650-167613-0012 HE ORDERED US TO RETREAT AND ALL OUR EFFORTS AND LOSSES WENT FOR NOTHING
1650-167613-0013 SO IT HAS BEEN WITH BARCLAY
1650-167613-0014 WHILE RUSSIA WAS WELL A FOREIGNER COULD SERVE HER AND BE A SPLENDID MINISTER BUT AS SOON AS SHE IS IN DANGER SHE NEEDS ONE OF HER OWN KIN
1650-167613-0015 AND THEY SAY HE'S A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REJOINED PIERRE
1650-167613-0016 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS MEANT BY A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REPLIED PRINCE ANDREW IRONICALLY
1650-167613-0017 A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REPLIED PIERRE
1650-167613-0018 PIERRE LOOKED AT HIM IN SURPRISE
1650-167613-0019 AND YET THEY SAY THAT WAR IS LIKE A GAME OF CHESS HE REMARKED
1650-167613-0020 THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF BODIES OF TROOPS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN TO ANYONE
1650-167613-0021 SUCCESS NEVER DEPENDS AND NEVER WILL DEPEND ON POSITION OR EQUIPMENT OR EVEN ON NUMBERS AND LEAST OF ALL ON POSITION BUT ON WHAT THEN
1650-167613-0022 ON THE FEELING THAT IS IN ME AND IN HIM HE POINTED TO TIMOKHIN AND IN EACH SOLDIER
1650-167613-0023 A BATTLE IS WON BY THOSE WHO FIRMLY RESOLVE TO WIN IT
1650-167613-0024 WHY DID WE LOSE THE BATTLE AT AUSTERLITZ
1650-167613-0025 WE'VE LOST SO LET US RUN AND WE RAN
1650-167613-0026 BUT TOMORROW WE SHAN'T SAY IT
1650-167613-0027 BUT WHAT AWAITS US TOMORROW
1650-167613-0028 THE FACT IS THAT THOSE MEN WITH WHOM YOU HAVE RIDDEN ROUND THE POSITION NOT ONLY DO NOT HELP MATTERS BUT HINDER
1650-167613-0029 THAT'S THE TRUTH THE REAL TRUTH SAID TIMOKHIN
1650-167613-0030 IT'S NOT THE DAY FOR THAT THEY SAY
1650-167613-0031 ALL WERE SILENT THE OFFICERS ROSE
1650-167613-0032 YES YES ANSWERED PRINCE ANDREW ABSENTLY
1650-167613-0033 THE FRENCH HAVE DESTROYED MY HOME AND ARE ON THEIR WAY TO DESTROY MOSCOW THEY HAVE OUTRAGED AND ARE OUTRAGING ME EVERY MOMENT THEY ARE MY ENEMIES
1650-167613-0034 IN MY OPINION THEY ARE ALL CRIMINALS
1650-167613-0035 AND SO THINKS TIMOKHIN AND THE WHOLE ARMY
1650-167613-0036 SINCE THEY ARE MY FOES THEY CANNOT BE MY FRIENDS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SAID AT TILSIT
1650-167613-0037 YES YES MUTTERED PIERRE LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES AT PRINCE ANDREW
1650-167613-0038 THEY TALK TO US OF THE RULES OF WAR OF CHIVALRY OF FLAGS OF TRUCE OF MERCY TO THE UNFORTUNATE AND SO ON IT'S ALL RUBBISH
1650-167613-0039 THEY PLUNDER OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES ISSUE FALSE PAPER MONEY AND WORST OF ALL THEY KILL MY CHILDREN AND MY FATHER AND THEN TALK OF RULES OF WAR AND MAGNANIMITY TO FOES
1650-167613-0040 TAKE NO PRISONERS BUT KILL AND BE KILLED
1650-167613-0041 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD THOUGHT IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO HIM WHETHER OR NOT MOSCOW WAS TAKEN AS SMOLENSK HAD BEEN WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED IN HIS SPEECH BY AN UNEXPECTED CRAMP IN HIS THROAT
1650-167613-0042 HE PACED UP AND DOWN A FEW TIMES IN SILENCE BUT HIS EYES GLITTERED FEVERISHLY AND HIS LIPS QUIVERED AS HE BEGAN SPEAKING
1650-167613-0043 AND WHEN THERE WAS A WAR LIKE THIS ONE IT WOULD BE WAR
1650-167613-0044 WHAT IS NEEDED FOR SUCCESS IN WARFARE
1650-167613-0045 AND IN SPITE OF ALL THIS IT IS THE HIGHEST CLASS RESPECTED BY EVERYONE
1650-167613-0046 HOW DOES GOD ABOVE LOOK AT THEM AND HEAR THEM
1650-167613-0047 I SEE THAT I HAVE BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND TOO MUCH
1650-167613-0048 AND IT DOESN'T DO FOR MAN TO TASTE OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL AH WELL IT'S NOT FOR LONG HE ADDED
1650-167613-0049 HOWEVER YOU'RE SLEEPY AND IT'S TIME FOR ME TO SLEEP
1650-167613-0050 GO BACK TO GORKI SAID PRINCE ANDREW SUDDENLY
1650-167613-0051 GO GO BEFORE A BATTLE ONE MUST HAVE ONE'S SLEEP OUT REPEATED PRINCE ANDREW
1650-167613-0052 NO HE DOES NOT WANT IT PIERRE CONCLUDED
1650-167613-0053 AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING
1650-167613-0054 ONE PICTURE SUCCEEDED ANOTHER IN HIS IMAGINATION
1650-167613-0055 ON ONE OF THEM HE DWELT LONG AND JOYFULLY
