2609-156975-0000 THEN MOSES WAS AFRAID AND SAID SURELY THE THING IS KNOWN
2609-156975-0001 HOLD ON HOLD FAST HOLD OUT PATIENCE IS GENIUS
2609-156975-0002 LET US HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MAKES MIGHT AND IN THAT FAITH LET US DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT LINCOLN
2609-156975-0003 THE EGYPTIAN BACKGROUND OF THE BONDAGE
2609-156975-0004 EVERY ONE WHO IS TURBULENT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KING MERNEPTAH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST BIBLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIAN INSCRIPTIONS GIVE OF THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0005 THE ABSENCE OF DETAILED REFERENCE TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY NATURAL
2609-156975-0006 IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ULTIMATELY COALESCED INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT
2609-156975-0007 THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES POSSIBLY TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDAH WERE THE CHIEF ACTORS IN THIS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY
2609-156975-0008 THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES APPARENTLY DISAGREE REGARDING THE DURATION OF THE SOJOURN IN EGYPT
2609-156975-0009 THE LATER TRADITIONS TEND TO EXTEND THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0010 HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY P ATUM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATUM
2609-156975-0011 A CONTEMPORARY INSCRIPTION ALSO STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITHUM THE HOUSE OF RAMSES A CITY WITH A ROYAL RESIDENCE AND TEMPLES
2609-156975-0012 THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THIS TYRANNY WAS NATURAL INEVITABLE
2609-156975-0013 WAS ANY OTHER PROCEDURE TO BE EXPECTED FROM A DESPOTIC RULER OF THAT LAND AND DAY
2609-156975-0014 THE MAKING OF A LOYAL PATRIOT
2609-156975-0015 THE STORY OF MOSES BIRTH AND EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY
2609-156975-0016 WAS MOSES JUSTIFIED IN RESISTING THE EGYPTIAN TASKMASTER
2609-156975-0017 IS PEONAGE ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING IT
2609-156975-0018 NATURALLY HE WENT TO THE LAND OF MIDIAN
2609-156975-0019 THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAD FOR CENTURIES BEEN THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR EGYPTIAN FUGITIVES
2609-156975-0020 FROM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND B C
2609-156975-0021 ON THE BORDERS OF THE WILDERNESS HE FOUND CERTAIN BEDOUIN HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY
2609-156975-0022 THESE SAND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KEDEM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
2609-156975-0023 LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE
2609-156975-0024 THE SCHOOL OF THE WILDERNESS
2609-156975-0025 THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT OF SINUHIT
2609-156975-0026 THE PRIEST OF THE SUB TRIBE OF THE KENITES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0027 NOTE THE CHARACTERISTIC ORIENTAL IDEA OF MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0028 HERE MOSES LEARNED THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS THE LEADER AND DELIVERER OF HIS PEOPLE
2609-156975-0029 AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN OF THEM WENT UP WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE
2609-156975-0030 MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KENITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAHWEH OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GOD WAS TRANSLATED BY LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0031 DO THE EARLIEST HEBREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAELITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0032 THE TITLE OF HIS FATHER IN LAW IMPLIES THAT THIS PRIEST MINISTERED AT SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY
2609-156975-0033 MOSES IN THE HOME OF THE MIDIAN PRIEST WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP
2609-156975-0034 THE CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING
2609-156975-0035 HIS QUEST WAS FOR A JUST AND STRONG GOD ABLE TO DELIVER THE OPPRESSED
2609-156975-0036 THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES AND THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENED HIS SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON A POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN
2609-156975-0037 THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST ANTOLIAN PLAIN IN CENTRAL ASIA MINOR STILL CALL EVERY LIFE GIVING SPRING GOD HATH GIVEN
2609-156975-0038 THE CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCKS ENTRUSTED TO MOSES CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND ACTION
