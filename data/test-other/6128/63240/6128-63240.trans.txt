6128-63240-0000 THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES
6128-63240-0001 THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
6128-63240-0002 SHE IS WILLING TO RISK THAT
6128-63240-0003 JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORK A DAY ASPECT
6128-63240-0004 HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE
6128-63240-0005 IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
6128-63240-0006 THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF A CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL
6128-63240-0007 THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
6128-63240-0008 AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANTS AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ELISIONS AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTON FIELD
6128-63240-0009 AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
6128-63240-0010 WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPERS AND ROARING RADICALS
6128-63240-0011 IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH MURDER
6128-63240-0012 HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LUNA WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
6128-63240-0013 SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE LATTER
6128-63240-0014 HAVE YOU BEEN IN EUROPE
6128-63240-0015 NO I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE
6128-63240-0016 SHE HATES IT SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT
6128-63240-0017 THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LUNA
6128-63240-0018 ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE
6128-63240-0019 AND MISSUS LUNA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
6128-63240-0020 ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FOR
6128-63240-0021 BESIDES OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BOSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
6128-63240-0022 THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY FORMS
6128-63240-0023 SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
6128-63240-0024 HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNA'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
6128-63240-0025 HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
6128-63240-0026 I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO A THEATRE PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY
6128-63240-0027 MISSUS LUNA'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANCELLOR THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
