8131-117016-0000 CAPTAIN MURDOCH
8131-117016-0001 BUT MARSPORT HAD FLOURISHED ENOUGH TO KILL IT OFF
8131-117016-0002 SOME OF MARS LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THE TYPE OF MEN
8131-117016-0003 THE STONEWALL GANG NUMBERED PERHAPS FIVE HUNDRED
8131-117016-0004 EVEN DERELICTS AND FAILURES HAD TO EAT THERE WERE STORES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF A MARGINAL LIVING
8131-117016-0005 THEY WERE SAFE FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS THERE NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR OUT
8131-117016-0006 THE SHOPKEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE THERE HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH
8131-117016-0007 CAPTAIN MURDOCH WAS AN UNKNOWN FACTOR AND NOW WAS ASKING FOR MORE MEN
8131-117016-0008 THE PRESSURE WAS ENOUGH TO GET THEM FOR HIM
8131-117016-0009 GORDON REPORTED FOR WORK WITH A SENSE OF THE BOTTOM FALLING OUT MIXED WITH A VAGUE RELIEF
8131-117016-0010 I'VE GOT A FREE HAND AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS THE WAY WE WOULD ON EARTH
8131-117016-0011 YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND THAT MEANS EVERYONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT NO GRAFT
8131-117016-0012 THE FIRST MAN MAKING A SHAKEDOWN WILL GET THE SAME TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO USE ON THE STONEWALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT
8131-117016-0013 HE PICKED OUT FIVE OF THE MEN INCLUDING GORDON YOU FIVE WILL COME WITH ME
8131-117016-0014 THE REST OF YOU CAN TEAM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT TONIGHT PICK ANY ROUTE THAT'S OPEN OKAY MEN LET'S GO
8131-117016-0015 BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MURDOCH'S EYES FELL ON HIM EARTH COP
8131-117016-0016 TWO YEARS GORDON ADMITTED
8131-117016-0017 FOR A SECOND GORDON CURSED HIMSELF
8131-117016-0018 HE BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT SECURITY THEN
8131-117016-0019 NOBODY HAD TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM
8131-117016-0020 THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS AT THE FRONT OF EACH BUILDING A DIM PHOSPHOR BULB GLOWED WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY
8131-117016-0021 MOVING IN TWO GROUPS OF THREES AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREET THEY BEGAN THEIR BEAT
8131-117016-0022 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE CITIZEN WHO WAS DYING FROM LACK OF AIR
8131-117016-0023 GORDON FELT THE SOLID PLEASURE OF THE FINELY TURNED CLUB IN HIS HANDS
8131-117016-0024 GORDON'S EYES POPPED AT THAT
8131-117016-0025 HE SWALLOWED THE SENTIMENT HIS OWN CLUB WAS MOVING NOW
8131-117016-0026 THE OTHER FOUR COPS HAD COME IN RELUCTANTLY
8131-117016-0027 HE BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND WITH A SINGLE BLOW ACROSS THE KIDNEYS
8131-117016-0028 THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE COPS STARTED OFF
8131-117016-0029 TO FIND A PHONE AND CALL THE WAGON
8131-117016-0030 WE'RE NOT USING WAGONS MURDOCH TOLD HIM LINE THEM UP
8131-117016-0031 IF THEY TRIED TO RUN THEY WERE HIT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED CAREFULLY
8131-117016-0032 MURDOCH INDICATED ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS SHOULDERS SHAKING AND TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
8131-117016-0033 THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS SICK AS GORDON FELT
8131-117016-0034 I WANT THE NAME OF EVERY MAN IN THE GANG YOU CAN REMEMBER HE TOLD THE MAN
8131-117016-0035 COLONEL THEY'D KILL ME I DON'T KNOW
8131-117016-0036 MURDOCH TOOK HIS NOD AS EVIDENCE ENOUGH AND TURNED TO THE WRETCHED TOUGHS
8131-117016-0037 IF HE SHOULD TURN UP DEAD I'LL KNOW YOU BOYS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND I'LL FIND YOU
8131-117016-0038 TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING SHORTLY AFTER THOUGH
8131-117016-0039 MURDOCH SENT ONE OF THE MEN TO PICK UP A SECOND SQUAD OF SIX AND THEN A THIRD
8131-117016-0040 IN THE THIRD ONE BRUCE GORDON SPOTTED ONE OF THE MEN WHO'D BEEN BEATEN BEFORE
8131-117016-0041 GET A STRETCHER AND TAKE HIM WHEREVER HE BELONGS HE ORDERED
8131-117016-0042 BUT THE CAPTAIN STIRRED FINALLY SIGHING
8131-117016-0043 NO THE COPS THEY'RE GIVING ME WE'RE COVERED GORDON
8131-117016-0044 BUT THE STONEWALL GANG IS BACKING WAYNE
8131-117016-0045 BUT IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH ON THEM
8131-117016-0046 BRUCE GORDON GRIMACED I'VE GOT A YELLOW TICKET FROM SECURITY
8131-117016-0047 MURDOCH BLINKED HE DROPPED HIS EYES SLOWLY
8131-117016-0048 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WAYNE WILL BE RE ELECTED
8131-117016-0049 NOBODY WANTS HIM EXCEPT A GANG OF CROOKS AND THOSE IN POWER
8131-117016-0050 EVER SEE A MARTIAN ELECTION
8131-117016-0051 NO YOU'RE A FIRSTER HE CAN'T LOSE
8131-117016-0052 AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP AND THIS WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
8131-117016-0053 IT FITTED WITH THE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WITH THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM
8131-117016-0054 HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW THAT HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE FAIR RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER
8131-117016-0055 COST EM MORE BUT THEY'D BE RESPECTABLE
8131-117016-0056 BECAUSE IZZY IS ALWAYS HONEST ACCORDING TO HOW HE SEES IT
8131-117016-0057 BUT YOU GOT EARTH IDEAS OF THE STUFF LIKE I HAD ONCE
8131-117016-0058 THE GROUPS GREW MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCH WAS TRAINING A NEW SQUAD EVERY NIGHT
8131-117016-0059 IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL BUT NOTHING WAS HERE
8131-117016-0060 THIS COULD LEAD TO ABUSES AS HE'D SEEN ON EARTH
8131-117016-0061 BUT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR IT IF MAYOR WAYNE WAS RE ELECTED
