3764-168670-0000 THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN ARE LIKE THE OGLING GLANCES OF A ONE EYED MAN THEY DO NOT REACH THEIR GOAL VERY PROMPTLY
3764-168670-0001 COSETTE HAD WAKED UP
3764-168670-0002 JEAN VALJEAN HAD PLACED HER NEAR THE FIRE
3764-168670-0003 YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT A LADY'S HOUSE I SHALL COME TO FETCH YOU
3764-168670-0004 EVERYTHING IS ARRANGED AND NOTHING IS SAID FAUCHELEVENT
3764-168670-0005 I HAVE PERMISSION TO BRING YOU IN BUT BEFORE BRINGING YOU IN YOU MUST BE GOT OUT
3764-168670-0006 THAT'S WHERE THE DIFFICULTY LIES
3764-168670-0007 IT IS EASY ENOUGH WITH THE CHILD YOU WILL CARRY HER OUT
3764-168670-0008 AND SHE WILL HOLD HER TONGUE I ANSWER FOR THAT
3764-168670-0009 FAUCHELEVENT GRUMBLED MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO JEAN VALJEAN
3764-168670-0010 YOU UNDERSTAND FATHER MADELEINE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOTICE IT
3764-168670-0011 JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND THOUGHT THAT HE WAS RAVING
3764-168670-0012 FAUCHELEVENT WENT ON
3764-168670-0013 IT IS TO MORROW THAT I AM TO BRING YOU IN THE PRIORESS EXPECTS YOU
3764-168670-0014 THEN HE EXPLAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE FOR A SERVICE WHICH HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO RENDER TO THE COMMUNITY
3764-168670-0015 THAT THE NUN WHO HAD DIED THAT MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN WHICH HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL
3764-168670-0016 THAT THE PRIORESS AND THE VOCAL MOTHERS INTENDED TO FULFIL THE WISH OF THE DECEASED
3764-168670-0017 THAT HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN IN THE CELL RAISE THE STONE IN THE CHAPEL AND LOWER THE CORPSE INTO THE VAULT
3764-168670-0018 AND THEN THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER THE EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0019 WHAT IS THAT EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0020 ASKED JEAN VALJEAN FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
3764-168670-0021 WHAT COFFIN WHAT ADMINISTRATION
3764-168670-0022 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS SEATED SPRANG UP AS THOUGH A BOMB HAD BURST UNDER HIS CHAIR YOU
3764-168670-0023 YOU KNOW FAUCHELEVENT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IS DEAD
3764-168670-0024 AND I ADD AND FATHER MADELEINE IS BURIED AH
3764-168670-0025 YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHER MEN FATHER MADELEINE
3764-168670-0026 THIS OFFERS THE MEANS BUT GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
3764-168670-0027 HOW LONG IS THE COFFIN SIX FEET
3764-168670-0028 IT IS A CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOW OPENING ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER INTO THE CHURCH WHAT CHURCH
3764-168670-0029 THE CHURCH IN THE STREET THE CHURCH WHICH ANY ONE CAN ENTER
3764-168670-0030 HAVE YOU THE KEYS TO THOSE TWO DOORS
3764-168670-0031 NO I HAVE THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CONVENT THE PORTER HAS THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHURCH
3764-168670-0032 ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY COME TO GET THE COFFIN
3764-168670-0033 WHO NAILS UP THE COFFIN I DO
3764-168670-0034 WHO SPREADS THE PALL OVER IT
3764-168670-0035 NOT ANOTHER MAN EXCEPT THE POLICE DOCTOR CAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM THAT IS EVEN WRITTEN ON THE WALL
3764-168670-0036 COULD YOU HIDE ME IN THAT ROOM TO NIGHT WHEN EVERY ONE IS ASLEEP
3764-168670-0037 ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
3764-168670-0038 I SHALL BE HUNGRY I WILL BRING YOU SOMETHING
3764-168670-0039 YOU CAN COME AND NAIL ME UP IN THE COFFIN AT TWO O'CLOCK
3764-168670-0040 FAUCHELEVENT RECOILED AND CRACKED HIS FINGER JOINTS BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
3764-168670-0041 BAH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER AND DRIVE SOME NAILS IN A PLANK
3764-168670-0042 JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN WORSE STRAITS THAN THIS
3764-168670-0043 ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTRACT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPE
3764-168670-0044 WHAT DOES NOT A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF A CURE
3764-168670-0045 TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS
3764-168670-0046 YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANK ON LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
3764-168670-0047 A MAN WHO IS MAKING HIS ESCAPE DOES NOT COUGH OR SNEEZE
3764-168670-0048 WHO IS THERE WHO HAS NOT SAID TO A CAT DO COME IN
3764-168670-0049 THE OVER PRUDENT CATS AS THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN THE AUDACIOUS
3764-168670-0050 BUT JEAN VALJEAN'S COOLNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED
3764-168670-0051 IF YOU ARE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I AM SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE
3764-168670-0052 AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVE DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVE AND I PUT THE GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
3764-168670-0053 I SHALL FOLLOW THAT IS MY BUSINESS
3764-168670-0054 THE HEARSE HALTS THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN KNOT A ROPE AROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
3764-168670-0055 THE PRIEST SAYS THE PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
3764-168670-0056 ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WILL NOT BE SOBER
3764-168670-0057 THAT IS SETTLED FATHER FAUCHELEVENT ALL WILL GO WELL
