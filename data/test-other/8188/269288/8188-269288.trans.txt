8188-269288-0000 ANNIE COLCHESTER HAD BEGUN TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH LESLIE
8188-269288-0001 LESLIE DETERMINED TO TRY FOR HONORS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE
8188-269288-0002 HER TASTES ALL LAY IN THIS DIRECTION HER IDEA BEING BY AND BY TO FOLLOW HER MOTHER'S PROFESSION OF JOURNALISM FOR WHICH SHE ALREADY SHOWED CONSIDERABLE APTITUDE
8188-269288-0003 SHE HAD NO IDEA OF ALLOWING HERSELF TO BREAK DOWN

8188-269288-0008 SAID ANNIE A FLASH OF LIGHT COMING INTO HER EYES AND THEN LEAVING THEM
8188-269288-0009 BUT SHE ADDED ABRUPTLY YOU SPEAK OF SOMETHING WHICH MUST NOT TAKE PLACE
8188-269288-0010 I MUST PASS IN HONORS IF I DON'T I SHALL DIE
8188-269288-0011 A FEW MOMENTS LATER THERE CAME A TAP AT THE DOOR
8188-269288-0012 LESLIE OPENED THE DOOR
8188-269288-0013 JANE HERIOT STOOD WITHOUT
8188-269288-0014 THESE LETTERS HAVE JUST COME FOR YOU AND ANNIE COLCHESTER SHE SAID AND AS I WAS COMING UPSTAIRS I THOUGHT I WOULD LEAVE THEM WITH YOU
8188-269288-0015 LESLIE THANKED HER AND EAGERLY GRASPED THE LITTLE PARCEL
8188-269288-0016 HER EYES SHONE WITH PLEASURE AT THE ANTICIPATION OF THE DELIGHTFUL TIME SHE WOULD HAVE REVELING IN THE HOME NEWS THE OTHER LETTER WAS DIRECTED TO ANNIE COLCHESTER

8188-269288-0020 WELL READ IT IN PEACE SAID LESLIE I WON'T DISTURB YOU
8188-269288-0021 I AM TRULY GLAD IT HAS COME
8188-269288-0022 LESLIE SEATED HERSELF WITH HER BACK TO HER COMPANION AND OPENED HER OWN LETTERS

8188-269288-0026 I SHALL GO I KNOW A WAY
8188-269288-0027 JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT SHE ROSE WITH A SIGH TO PREPARE FOR BED
8188-269288-0028 SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM
8188-269288-0029 NOW I REMEMBER SHE GOT A LETTER WHICH UPSET HER VERY MUCH AND WENT OUT
8188-269288-0030 LESLIE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND FLUNG IT OPEN SHE PUT HER HEAD OUT AND TRIED TO PEER INTO THE DARKNESS BUT THE MOON HAD ALREADY SET AND SHE COULD NOT SEE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF YARDS IN FRONT OF HER
8188-269288-0031 SHE IS A VERY QUEER ERRATIC CREATURE AND THAT LETTER THERE WAS BAD NEWS IN THAT LETTER
8188-269288-0032 WHAT CAN SHE BE DOING OUT BY HERSELF
8188-269288-0033 LESLIE LEFT THE ROOM BUT SHE HAD SCARCELY GONE A DOZEN PACES DOWN THE CORRIDOR BEFORE SHE MET ANNIE RETURNING
8188-269288-0034 ANNIE'S EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT HER CHEEKS WERE NO LONGER PALE AND THERE WAS A BRILLIANT COLOR IN THEM
8188-269288-0035 SHE DID NOT TAKE THE LEAST NOTICE OF LESLIE BUT GOING INTO THE ROOM SHUT THE DOOR
8188-269288-0036 DON'T BEGIN SAID ANNIE
8188-269288-0037 DON'T BEGIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN
8188-269288-0038 I MEAN THAT I DON'T WANT YOU TO BEGIN TO ASK QUESTIONS
8188-269288-0039 I WALKED UP AND DOWN AS FAST AS EVER I COULD OUTSIDE IN ORDER TO MAKE MYSELF SLEEPY
8188-269288-0040 DON'T TALK TO ME LESLIE DON'T SAY A SINGLE WORD
8188-269288-0041 I SHALL GO OFF TO SLEEP THAT IS ALL I CARE FOR
8188-269288-0042 DON'T SAID ANNIE
8188-269288-0043 NOW DRINK THIS AT ONCE SHE SAID IN A VOICE OF AUTHORITY IF YOU REALLY WISH TO SLEEP
8188-269288-0044 ANNIE STARED VACANTLY AT THE COCOA THEN SHE UTTERED A LAUGH
8188-269288-0045 DRINK THAT SHE SAID
8188-269288-0046 DO YOU WANT TO KILL ME DON'T TALK ANY MORE
8188-269288-0047 I AM SLEEPY I SHALL SLEEP
8188-269288-0048 SHE GOT INTO BED AS SHE SPOKE AND WRAPPED THE CLOTHES TIGHTLY ROUND HER
8188-269288-0049 CAN'T YOU MANAGE WITH A CANDLE JUST FOR ONCE
8188-269288-0050 CERTAINLY SAID LESLIE
8188-269288-0051 SHE TURNED OFF THE LIGHT AND LIT A CANDLE WHICH SHE PUT BEHIND HER SCREEN THEN PREPARED TO GET INTO BED
8188-269288-0052 ANNIE'S MANNER WAS VERY MYSTERIOUS
8188-269288-0053 ANNIE DID NOT MEAN TO CONFIDE IN ANYONE THAT NIGHT AND THE KINDEST THING WAS TO LEAVE HER ALONE
8188-269288-0054 TIRED OUT LESLIE HERSELF DROPPED ASLEEP
8188-269288-0055 ANNIE IS THAT YOU SHE CALLED OUT
8188-269288-0056 THERE WAS NO REPLY BUT THE SOUND OF HURRYING STEPS CAME QUICKER AND QUICKER NOW AND THEN THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY A GROAN
8188-269288-0057 OH THIS WILL KILL ME MY HEART WILL BREAK THIS WILL KILL ME
