367-293981-0009 THE OFFICER TURNED TO HIM AND SAID WELL HOW GOES IT GOOD MAN
367-293981-0010 SANCHO GOT UP WITH PAIN ENOUGH IN HIS BONES AND WENT AFTER THE INNKEEPER IN THE DARK AND MEETING THE OFFICER WHO WAS LOOKING TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIS ENEMY HE SAID TO HIM SENOR WHOEVER YOU ARE DO US THE FAVOUR AND KINDNESS TO GIVE US A LITTLE ROSEMARY OIL SALT AND WINE FOR IT IS WANTED TO CURE ONE OF THE BEST KNIGHTS ERRANT ON EARTH WHO LIES ON YONDER BED WOUNDED BY THE HANDS OF THE ENCHANTED MOOR THAT IS IN THIS INN
367-293981-0011 TO BE BRIEF HE TOOK THE MATERIALS OF WHICH HE MADE A COMPOUND MIXING THEM ALL AND BOILING THEM A GOOD WHILE UNTIL IT SEEMED TO HIM THEY HAD COME TO PERFECTION
367-293981-0012 SANCHO PANZA WHO ALSO REGARDED THE AMENDMENT OF HIS MASTER AS MIRACULOUS BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HIM WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE PIGSKIN WHICH WAS NO SMALL QUANTITY
367-293981-0013 DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING IT WITH BOTH HANDS IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH A BETTER WILL GULPED DOWN AND DRAINED OFF VERY LITTLE LESS THAN HIS MASTER

367-293981-0019 HE SAW HIM RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HAD HIS RAGE ALLOWED HIM IT IS MY BELIEF HE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED
