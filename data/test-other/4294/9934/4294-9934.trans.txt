4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER
4294-9934-0001 HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4294-9934-0008 HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRAC
4294-9934-0013 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW
4294-9934-0014 SILVER GOLD HERE IT IS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOTS
4294-9934-0016 THAT WILL BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017 NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 DO YOU KNOW GERMAN NO
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT FOR
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S
4294-9934-0022 HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HELLO I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT
4294-9934-0025 I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT
