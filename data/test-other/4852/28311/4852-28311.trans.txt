4852-28311-0000 SAY YOU KNOW SUMTHIN
4852-28311-0001 CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CAR JACK AND SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 KNOW WHO NEEDS A JOB BAD THAT'S JAKEY HARRIS
4852-28311-0003 O K HE SAID
4852-28311-0004 ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF
4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT INTO M STREET
4852-28311-0006 WELL HE ADMITTED I DID
4852-28311-0007 CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0008 THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKEY WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGING INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BETCHA AREN'T GOIN AFTER ALL CHRIS TURNED ON HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE CORNER
4852-28311-0013 AW SHUCKS
4852-28311-0014 CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING THE BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK HAD A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ONTO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUBS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GRAY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH HIS JOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE
4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CAR HORN WOKE HIM FROM HIS DREAM
