1688-142285-0000 THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANON
1688-142285-0001 MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUEST DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY
1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKED THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS THE THING I LIKED BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU WHO WERE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY AT HELSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 HIS FATHER DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKHOUSE
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORWARDS TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISSUS THORNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0014 SO THEY LEFT MILTON
1688-142285-0015 HOW TAINTED ASKED HER FATHER
1688-142285-0016 OH PAPA BY THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT
1688-142285-0020 IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WORDS
1688-142285-0021 MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER OUT IT CAME
1688-142285-0024 PAPA I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
1688-142285-0025 AND I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
1688-142285-0026 PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT AND ALL
1688-142285-0027 I DON'T SET HIM UP FOR A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
1688-142285-0028 BUT GOOD NIGHT CHILD
1688-142285-0029 THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HALE
1688-142285-0030 SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN HER BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF THEIR MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP HER WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTION SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1688-142285-0036 ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER
1688-142285-0037 WELL BESSY HOW ARE YOU
1688-142285-0038 BETTER AND NOT BETTER IF YO KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
1688-142285-0039 NOT EXACTLY REPLIED MARGARET SMILING
1688-142285-0040 I'M BETTER IN NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O'NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED O MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND O BEULAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FARTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
1688-142285-0041 MARGARET TURNED ROUND TO WALK ALONGSIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD
1688-142285-0042 BUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK
1688-142285-0043 AT LAST SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
1688-142285-0044 BESSY DO YOU WISH TO DIE
1688-142285-0045 BESSY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE REPLIED
1688-142285-0046 NOUGHT WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON
1688-142285-0047 BUT WHAT WAS IT
1688-142285-0048 YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE AT MILTON
1688-142285-0049 I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY
1688-142285-0050 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I GO WITH YOU NOW
1688-142285-0051 THE SHARPNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0052 AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT OF A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAID
1688-142285-0053 YO'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GRUFFISH AT FIRST
1688-142285-0054 BUT NICHOLAS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTERED
1688-142285-0055 GASPED BESSY AT LAST
1688-142285-0056 BESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
1688-142285-0057 MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
1688-142285-0058 REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS
1688-142285-0059 NOW I'LL NOT HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED TO
1688-142285-0060 BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
1688-142285-0061 I BELIEVE WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE
1688-142285-0062 THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG WOMAN
1688-142285-0063 I DON'T BELIEVE ALL I HEAR NO NOT BY A BIG DEAL
1688-142285-0064 BUT HOO'S COME AT LAST AND HOO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HOO'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT HOO KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT
1688-142285-0065 IT'S SIMPLE AND NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR HARD TO WORK
1688-142285-0066 BUT THE GIRL ONLY PLEADED THE MORE WITH MARGARET
1688-142285-0067 DON'T THINK HARDLY ON HIM HE'S A GOOD MAN HE IS
1688-142285-0068 I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MOPED WI SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF FATHER IS NOT THERE
1688-142285-0069 THE FEVERISH COLOUR CAME INTO HER CHEEK AND THE FEVERISH FLAME INTO HER EYE
1688-142285-0070 BUT YOU WILL BE THERE FATHER YOU SHALL OH MY HEART
1688-142285-0071 SHE PUT HER HAND TO IT AND BECAME GHASTLY PALE
1688-142285-0072 MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BOSOM
1688-142285-0073 PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID
1688-142285-0074 I'LL GO TO BED IT'S BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YO'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YO WILL BUT JUST SAY IT
1688-142285-0075 I WILL COME TO MORROW SAID MARGARET
1688-142285-0076 MARGARET WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND THOUGHTFUL
1688-142285-0077 SHE WAS LATE FOR TEA AT HOME
1688-142285-0078 HAVE YOU MET WITH A SERVANT DEAR
1688-142285-0079 NO MAMMA THAT ANNE BUCKLEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE
1688-142285-0080 SUPPOSE I TRY SAID MISTER HALE
1688-142285-0081 EVERYBODY ELSE HAS HAD THEIR TURN AT THIS GREAT DIFFICULTY NOW LET ME TRY
1688-142285-0082 I MAY BE THE CINDERELLA TO PUT ON THE SLIPPER AFTER ALL
1688-142285-0083 WHAT WOULD YOU DO PAPA HOW WOULD YOU SET ABOUT IT
1688-142285-0084 WHY I WOULD APPLY TO SOME GOOD HOUSE MOTHER TO RECOMMEND ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERVANTS
1688-142285-0085 VERY GOOD BUT WE MUST FIRST CATCH OUR HOUSE MOTHER
1688-142285-0086 THE MOTHER OF WHOM HE SPOKE TO US SAID MARGARET
1688-142285-0087 MISSUS THORNTON THE ONLY MOTHER HE HAS I BELIEVE SAID MISTER HALE QUIETLY
1688-142285-0088 I SHALL LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED
1688-142285-0089 PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLACE
1688-142285-0090 SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANY ONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY
1688-142285-0091 MY DEAR SAID MISTER HALE ALARMED PRAY DON'T GO OFF ON THAT IDEA
1688-142285-0092 I AM SURE AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1688-142285-0093 TAKE NOTICE THAT IS NOT MY KIND OF HAUGHTINESS PAPA IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL WHICH I DON'T AGREE TO THOUGH YOU'RE ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT
1688-142285-0094 I DON'T KNOW POSITIVELY THAT IT IS HERS EITHER BUT FROM LITTLE THINGS I HAVE GATHERED FROM HIM I FANCY SO
1688-142285-0095 THEY CARED TOO LITTLE TO ASK IN WHAT MANNER HER SON HAD SPOKEN ABOUT HER
