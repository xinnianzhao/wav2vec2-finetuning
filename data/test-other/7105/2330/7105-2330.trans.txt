7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION AS TO PLATTERBAFF'S GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0004 A HEADLONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF A BYE ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DOWNING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTRES
7105-2330-0006 THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A DEATHLIKE HUSH
7105-2330-0007 THE FOREMAN DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE
7105-2330-0008 THE JURY FIND THE PRISONER GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0009 THE JURY WISH TO ADD A RIDER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A BY ELECTION IS PENDING IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMESIS ON HAND
7105-2330-0010 AND MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE POLL A JUNIOR COUNSEL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY
7105-2330-0011 FIFTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OF
7105-2330-0012 OUR MAJORITY LAST TIME WAS ONLY A THOUSAND AND SEVEN
7105-2330-0013 SEVEN THIRTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER WE MUST AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITANCY
7105-2330-0014 NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANISER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTERBAFF IS OUT BEFORE THE POLL OPENS
7105-2330-0015 HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RADPROP IS IN TO NIGHT
7105-2330-0016 DESPITE THE EARLINESS OF THE HOUR A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THE HORRIBLE MENACING TRELAWNEY REFRAIN OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOTING MEN CAME IN A STEADY MONOTONOUS CHANT
7105-2330-0017 HE EXCLAIMED WON'T GO
7105-2330-0018 HE SAYS HE NEVER HAS LEFT PRISON WITHOUT A BRASS BAND TO PLAY HIM OUT AND HE'S NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT ONE NOW
7105-2330-0019 SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY A RELEASED PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD WE DEFEND IT ON THE ESTIMATES
7105-2330-0020 ANYWAY HE WON'T GO UNLESS HE HAS A BAND
7105-2330-0021 POLL OPENS IN FIVE MINUTES
7105-2330-0022 IS PLATTERBAFF OUT YET
7105-2330-0023 IN HEAVEN'S NAME WHY
7105-2330-0024 THE CHIEF ORGANISER RANG OFF
7105-2330-0025 THIS IS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING ON DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY MUSICIANS MUST BE SUPPLIED AT ONCE
7105-2330-0026 CAN'T YOU GET A STRIKE PERMIT ASKED THE ORGANISER
7105-2330-0027 I'LL TRY SAID THE HOME SECRETARY AND WENT TO THE TELEPHONE
7105-2330-0028 EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWD OUTSIDE CHANTED WITH AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND WILL VOTE THE OTHER WAY
7105-2330-0029 A TELEGRAM WAS BROUGHT IN
7105-2330-0030 IT WAS FROM THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE ROOMS AT NEMESIS
7105-2330-0031 WITHOUT A BAND HE WOULD NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BAND
7105-2330-0032 A QUARTER PAST TEN HALF PAST
7105-2330-0033 HAVE YOU ANY BAND INSTRUMENTS OF AN EASY NATURE TO PLAY
7105-2330-0034 DEMANDED THE CHIEF ORGANISER OF THE PRISON GOVERNOR DRUMS CYMBALS THOSE SORT OF THINGS
7105-2330-0035 THE WARDERS HAVE A PRIVATE BAND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T ALLOW THE MEN THEMSELVES
7105-2330-0036 LEND US THE INSTRUMENTS SAID THE CHIEF ORGANISER
7105-2330-0037 THE POPULAR SONG OF THE MOMENT REPLIED THE AGITATOR AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
7105-2330-0038 IT WAS A TUNE THEY HAD ALL HEARD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SO THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT A PASSABLE IMITATION OF IT TO THE IMPROVISED STRAINS OF I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT THE PRISONER STRODE FORTH TO FREEDOM
7105-2330-0039 THE WORD OF THE SONG HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0040 THE SEAT WAS LOST AFTER ALL BY A NARROW MAJORITY
7105-2330-0041 THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENCE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS STRIKE BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELEASE OF PLATTERBAFF FAILED TO PACIFY THEM
