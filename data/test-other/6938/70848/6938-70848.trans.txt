6938-70848-0000 EVEN THE SUN CAME OUT PALE AND WATERY AT NOON
6938-70848-0001 THE COLDS AND RHEUMATISM OF THE RAINY MONTHS VANISHED
6938-70848-0002 ASKED A WORKER LAST SUNDAY YOU DID IT WHEN THE YUNKERS

6938-70848-0015 UPON MY RETURN I VISITED SMOLNY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THERE AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT AND THAT'S ALL LET ANY ONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION
6938-70848-0016 MEANWHILE THE QUESTION OF THE STATUS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WAS AGITATING ALL MINDS
6938-70848-0017 BY DECLARING THE ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAD BEEN PLANNED TO BLOCK THE REELECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
6938-70848-0018 BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS
6938-70848-0019 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGRARIAN PROGRAMME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES

6938-70848-0024 HE KNEW THAT AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN CONCLUDED
6938-70848-0025 HE SPOKE TO THE RUMP CONVENTION
6938-70848-0026 THE VILLAGES WILL SAVE US IN THE END
6938-70848-0027 BUT THE PRESENT MOVEMENT IS INTERNATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY IT IS INVINCIBLE
6938-70848-0028 THE WILL OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS IS NOW CONCENTRATED IN THIS HALL
