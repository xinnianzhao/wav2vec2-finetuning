3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO WIDEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED TILL HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAYS
3331-159609-0004 TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
3331-159609-0005 NO I M ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
3331-159609-0007 I TRY NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
3331-159609-0008 THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT
3331-159609-0009 CRIED POLLY WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
3331-159609-0010 POOR POLLY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
3331-159609-0011 NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELLTALE FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF JOKINGLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
3331-159609-0013 IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS BEFORE
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER IN ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATE THEIR RESPECTIVE VALUES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
3331-159609-0015 I HOPE MARIA BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS HER SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD N'T BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0016 SAID FANNY TURNING HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BEAR THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINTER FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH THE GIRLS
3331-159609-0020 IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SYDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING OVER BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHAWS
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDERED AT IT MOST
3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER DARKNESS
3331-159609-0024 FANNY CAME WALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY WE READ
