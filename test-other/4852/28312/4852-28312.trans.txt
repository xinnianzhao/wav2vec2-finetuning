4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
4852-28312-0001 SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOMEONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM
4852-28312-0002 WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBER
4852-28312-0003 HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
4852-28312-0004 MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
4852-28312-0005 THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEKBONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0006 LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES
4852-28312-0007 CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0008 CHRIS SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
4852-28312-0009 YES SIR HE SAID
4852-28312-0010 I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0011 HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE
4852-28312-0012 JAKEY HARRIS HIS NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0013 I I JUST WONDERED IF THE PLACE WAS STILL OPEN
4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
4852-28312-0015 HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND
4852-28312-0016 WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKEY'S GETTING THE JOB SIR
4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WATER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS
4852-28312-0018 THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY STILL
4852-28312-0019 THEN IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
4852-28312-0020 THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
4852-28312-0021 ACROSS THE WATER WHERE WAS THE FREEWAY
4852-28312-0022 IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKESTACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28312-0023 THE WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0024 FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION
4852-28312-0025 NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPLIT STREETS
4852-28312-0026 WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUGSTORE HAD STOOD BUT A HALF HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN
4852-28312-0027 A COURTYARD WAS SPARSELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
4852-28312-0028 THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
4852-28312-0029 A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLAGGED COURTYARD
4852-28312-0030 THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE
4852-28312-0031 MY WINDOW HAS A POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
