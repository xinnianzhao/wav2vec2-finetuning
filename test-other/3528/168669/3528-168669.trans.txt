3528-168669-0000 THE PRIORESS RETURNED AND SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE ON HER CHAIR
3528-168669-0001 WE WILL PRESENT A STENOGRAPHIC REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
3528-168669-0002 FATHER FAUVENT
3528-168669-0003 REVEREND MOTHER DO YOU KNOW THE CHAPEL
3528-168669-0004 AND YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE CHOIR IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES TWO OR THREE TIMES
3528-168669-0005 THERE IS A STONE TO BE RAISED HEAVY
3528-168669-0006 THE SLAB OF THE PAVEMENT WHICH IS AT THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR
3528-168669-0007 THE SLAB WHICH CLOSES THE VAULT YES
3528-168669-0008 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN FOR IT
3528-168669-0009 A WOMAN IS NEVER A MAN
3528-168669-0010 BECAUSE DOM MABILLON GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN EPISTLES OF SAINT BERNARD WHILE MERLONUS HORSTIUS ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MERLONUS HORSTIUS NEITHER DO I
3528-168669-0011 MERIT CONSISTS IN WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH A CLOISTER IS NOT A DOCK YARD
3528-168669-0012 AND A WOMAN IS NOT A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG ONE THOUGH
3528-168669-0013 AND CAN YOU GET A LEVER
3528-168669-0014 THERE IS A RING IN THE STONE
3528-168669-0015 I WILL PUT THE LEVER THROUGH IT
3528-168669-0016 THAT IS GOOD REVEREND MOTHER I WILL OPEN THE VAULT
3528-168669-0017 WILL THAT BE ALL NO
3528-168669-0018 GIVE ME YOUR ORDERS VERY REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0019 FAUVENT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
3528-168669-0020 I AM HERE TO DO ANYTHING YOU WISH
3528-168669-0021 AND TO HOLD YOUR PEACE ABOUT EVERYTHING YES REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0022 WHEN THE VAULT IS OPEN I WILL CLOSE IT AGAIN
3528-168669-0023 BUT BEFORE THAT WHAT REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0024 FATHER FAUVENT REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0025 YOU KNOW THAT A MOTHER DIED THIS MORNING
3528-168669-0026 NO DID YOU NOT HEAR THE BELL
3528-168669-0027 NOTHING CAN BE HEARD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN REALLY
3528-168669-0028 AND THEN THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN MY DIRECTION THIS MORNING
3528-168669-0029 IT WAS MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0030 THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER AH
3528-168669-0031 THE MOTHERS HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE CHURCH I KNOW
3528-168669-0032 A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0033 HEY MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0034 WHAT DO YOU SAY
3528-168669-0035 I SAY MORE OFTEN MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT
3528-168669-0036 REVEREND MOTHER I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT I SAID MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0037 BUT I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0038 AT THAT MOMENT NINE O'CLOCK STRUCK
3528-168669-0039 AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AT ALL HOURS PRAISED AND ADORED BE THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR SAID THE PRIORESS
3528-168669-0040 IT CUT MORE OFTEN SHORT
3528-168669-0041 FAUCHELEVENT MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD
3528-168669-0042 IN HER LIFETIME MOTHER CRUCIFIXION MADE CONVERTS AFTER HER DEATH SHE WILL PERFORM MIRACLES SHE WILL
3528-168669-0043 FATHER FAUVENT THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BLESSED IN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0044 SHE RETAINED HER CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT
3528-168669-0045 SHE GAVE US HER LAST COMMANDS
3528-168669-0046 IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN HER CELL SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TOUCHING IT SHE SMILED
3528-168669-0047 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF PARADISE IN THAT DEATH
3528-168669-0048 FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN ORISON WHICH SHE WAS FINISHING
3528-168669-0049 FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIS PEACE SHE WENT ON
3528-168669-0050 I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABORING IN OUR LORD WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THE CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUIT
3528-168669-0051 FORTUNATELY THE PRIORESS COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID NOT HEAR IT
3528-168669-0052 SHE CONTINUED FATHER FAUVENT
3528-168669-0053 YES REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0054 SAINT TERENTIUS BISHOP OF PORT WHERE THE MOUTH OF THE TIBER EMPTIES INTO THE SEA REQUESTED THAT ON HIS TOMB MIGHT BE ENGRAVED THE SIGN WHICH WAS PLACED ON THE GRAVES OF PARRICIDES IN THE HOPE THAT PASSERS BY WOULD SPIT ON HIS TOMB THIS WAS DONE
3528-168669-0055 THE DEAD MUST BE OBEYED SO BE IT
3528-168669-0056 FOR THAT MATTER NO REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0057 FATHER FAUVENT MOTHER CRUCIFIXION WILL BE INTERRED IN THE COFFIN IN WHICH SHE HAS SLEPT FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THAT IS JUST
3528-168669-0058 IT IS A CONTINUATION OF HER SLUMBER

3528-168669-0066 YOU WILL HAVE AN IRON BAR YES BUT
3528-168669-0067 YOU WILL RAISE THE STONE WITH THE BAR BY MEANS OF THE RING BUT
3528-168669-0068 THE DEAD MUST BE OBEYED TO BE BURIED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL NOT TO GO TO PROFANE EARTH TO REMAIN THERE IN DEATH WHERE SHE PRAYED WHILE LIVING SUCH WAS THE LAST WISH OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0069 SHE ASKED IT OF US THAT IS TO SAY COMMANDED US
3528-168669-0070 BUT IT IS FORBIDDEN
3528-168669-0071 OH I AM A STONE IN YOUR WALLS
3528-168669-0072 THINK FATHER FAUVENT IF SHE WERE TO WORK MIRACLES HERE
3528-168669-0073 WHAT A GLORY OF GOD FOR THE COMMUNITY AND MIRACLES ISSUE FROM TOMBS
3528-168669-0074 BUT REVEREND MOTHER IF THE AGENT OF THE SANITARY COMMISSION
3528-168669-0075 BUT THE COMMISSARY OF POLICE
3528-168669-0076 CHONODEMAIRE ONE OF THE SEVEN GERMAN KINGS WHO ENTERED AMONG THE GAULS UNDER THE EMPIRE OF CONSTANTIUS EXPRESSLY RECOGNIZED THE RIGHT OF NUNS TO BE BURIED IN RELIGION THAT IS TO SAY BENEATH THE ALTAR
3528-168669-0077 THE WORLD IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CROSS
3528-168669-0078 MARTIN THE ELEVENTH GENERAL OF THE CARTHUSIANS GAVE TO HIS ORDER THIS DEVICE STAT CRUX DUM VOLVITUR ORBIS
3528-168669-0079 THE PRIORESS WHO WAS USUALLY SUBJECTED TO THE BARRIER OF SILENCE AND WHOSE RESERVOIR WAS OVERFULL ROSE AND EXCLAIMED WITH THE LOQUACITY OF A DAM WHICH HAS BROKEN AWAY

3528-168669-0085 NO ONE DOUBTS THE RIGHT OF THE MONASTERY TO SEPULTURE
3528-168669-0086 ONLY FANATICS AND THOSE IN ERROR DENY IT
3528-168669-0087 WE LIVE IN TIMES OF TERRIBLE CONFUSION
3528-168669-0088 WE ARE IGNORANT AND IMPIOUS
3528-168669-0089 AND THEN RELIGION IS ATTACKED WHY
3528-168669-0090 BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN BAD PRIESTS BECAUSE SAGITTAIRE BISHOP OF GAP WAS THE BROTHER OF SALONE BISHOP OF EMBRUN AND BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM FOLLOWED MOMMOL

3528-168669-0092 THEY SHUT THEIR EYES TO THE TRUTH DARKNESS IS THE RULE
