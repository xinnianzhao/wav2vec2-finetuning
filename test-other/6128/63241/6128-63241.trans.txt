6128-63241-0000 POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BOEOTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT
6128-63241-0001 THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNA'S SISTER
6128-63241-0002 RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
6128-63241-0003 HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
6128-63241-0004 SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST A RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
6128-63241-0005 HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT
6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
6128-63241-0007 IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
6128-63241-0008 IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
6128-63241-0009 OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63241-0010 SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL
6128-63241-0011 SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
6128-63241-0012 HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED
6128-63241-0013 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BASIL RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
