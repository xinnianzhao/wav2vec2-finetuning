3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WATCH THE FOALS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTAFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY CINDERLAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDERLAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
