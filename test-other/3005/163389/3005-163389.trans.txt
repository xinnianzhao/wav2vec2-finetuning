3005-163389-0000 THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHERBURN'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK FOR THE NOISE
3005-163389-0001 SOME SUNG OUT TEAR DOWN THE FENCE TEAR DOWN THE FENCE
3005-163389-0002 THE STILLNESS WAS AWFUL CREEPY AND UNCOMFORTABLE
3005-163389-0003 SHERBURN RUN HIS EYE SLOW ALONG THE CROWD AND WHEREVER IT STRUCK THE PEOPLE TRIED A LITTLE TO OUT GAZE HIM BUT THEY COULDN'T THEY DROPPED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED SNEAKY
3005-163389-0004 THE AVERAGE MAN'S A COWARD
3005-163389-0005 BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THE MAN'S FRIENDS WILL SHOOT THEM IN THE BACK IN THE DARKAND IT'S JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO
3005-163389-0006 SO THEY ALWAYS ACQUIT AND THEN A MAN GOES IN THE NIGHT WITH A HUNDRED MASKED COWARDS AT HIS BACK AND LYNCHES THE RASCAL
3005-163389-0007 YOU DIDN'T WANT TO COME
3005-163389-0008 BUT A MOB WITHOUT ANY MAN AT THE HEAD OF IT IS BENEATH PITIFULNESS
3005-163389-0009 NOW LEAVE AND TAKE YOUR HALF A MAN WITH YOU TOSSING HIS GUN UP ACROSS HIS LEFT ARM AND COCKING IT WHEN HE SAYS THIS
3005-163389-0010 THE CROWD WASHED BACK SUDDEN AND THEN BROKE ALL APART AND WENT TEARING OFF EVERY WHICH WAY AND BUCK HARKNESS HE HEELED IT AFTER THEM LOOKING TOLERABLE CHEAP
3005-163389-0011 YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL
3005-163389-0012 THEY ARGUED AND TRIED TO KEEP HIM OUT BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN AND THE WHOLE SHOW COME TO A STANDSTILL
3005-163389-0013 AND ONE OR TWO WOMEN BEGUN TO SCREAM
3005-163389-0014 SO THEN THE RINGMASTER HE MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND SAID HE HOPED THERE WOULDN'T BE NO DISTURBANCE AND IF THE MAN WOULD PROMISE HE WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE TROUBLE HE WOULD LET HIM RIDE IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD STAY ON THE HORSE
3005-163389-0015 IT WARN'T FUNNY TO ME THOUGH I WAS ALL OF A TREMBLE TO SEE HIS DANGER
3005-163389-0016 AND THE HORSE A GOING LIKE A HOUSE AFIRE TOO
3005-163389-0017 HE SHED THEM SO THICK THEY KIND OF CLOGGED UP THE AIR AND ALTOGETHER HE SHED SEVENTEEN SUITS
3005-163389-0018 WHY IT WAS ONE OF HIS OWN MEN
