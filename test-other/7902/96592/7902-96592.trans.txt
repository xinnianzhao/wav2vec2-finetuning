7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHY RAYSTOKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A QUEER DREAM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF

7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARD THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 RAM WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE

7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS BREAST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LABOUR IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALISED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR ASSAILING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0031 BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPPED AND THRUST BACK THE DIRK INTO ITS SHEATH
