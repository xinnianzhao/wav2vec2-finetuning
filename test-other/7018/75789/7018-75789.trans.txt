7018-75789-0004 AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY FOR THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT AND MY TERROR AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH
7018-75789-0005 WHEN I AWOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STREAM AND THE RAFT MOORED TO AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS

7018-75789-0012 SO I CONSORTED WITH THE CHIEF OF THE ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT
7018-75789-0013 SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH THE MERCHANTS FOR THAT I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MINE OWN LAND

7018-75789-0017 HE ASKED ME WHENCE THEY CAME AND I SAID TO HIM BY ALLAH O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I KNOW NOT THE NAME OF THE CITY NOR THE WAY THITHER

7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELLOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIX
7018-75789-0023 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NIGHT
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFEL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT

7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BALES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGHDAD CITY TO BASSORAH TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FOR SEA AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TIGHTENING HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SATAN THE STONED CLOMB TO THE MAST HEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BEARD

7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE THAN WHICH WE HAD SEEN NAUGHT MORE MONSTROUS
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
