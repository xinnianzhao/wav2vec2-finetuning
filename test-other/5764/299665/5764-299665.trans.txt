5764-299665-0000 AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMBS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THIS GOD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVEST
5764-299665-0001 WHETHER HE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOURSELF AND MYSELF
5764-299665-0002 WHETHER ANY PRAYER WAS EVER ANSWERED
5764-299665-0003 WHY DID HE CREATE THE INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR
5764-299665-0004 WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HELPLESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
5764-299665-0005 ARE THE FAILURES UNDER OBLIGATION TO THEIR CREATOR
5764-299665-0006 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED
5764-299665-0007 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH THE LASH FOR THE BABES THAT HAVE BEEN SOLD FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
5764-299665-0008 IS THIS GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE THUMB SCREW AND RACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
5764-299665-0009 DID THIS GOD ALLOW THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS
5764-299665-0010 DID HE ALLOW TYRANTS TO SHED THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS
5764-299665-0011 CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A DEVIL BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS
5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT DEVOUR HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
5764-299665-0013 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WHERE LIFE FEEDS ON LIFE
5764-299665-0014 DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTIONALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC NERVE THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE
5764-299665-0015 FEAR BUILDS THE ALTAR AND OFFERS THE SACRIFICE
5764-299665-0016 FEAR ERECTS THE CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEAD OF MAN IN WORSHIP
5764-299665-0017 LIPS RELIGIOUS AND FEARFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM
5764-299665-0018 CAN WE SAY THAT HE CARED FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN
5764-299665-0019 CAN WE SAY THAT HIS MERCY ENDURETH FOREVER
5764-299665-0020 DO WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THOUSANDS OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE
5764-299665-0021 WAS THERE GOODNESS WAS THERE WISDOM IN THIS
5764-299665-0022 OUGHT THE SUPERIOR RACES TO THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT THE INFERIOR
5764-299665-0023 MOST PEOPLE CLING TO THE SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0024 IF THEY GIVE UP ONE GOD THEY IMAGINE ANOTHER
5764-299665-0025 WHAT IS THIS POWER
5764-299665-0026 MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSARILY ADVANCES THROUGH EXPERIENCE
5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE COMES TO WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES
5764-299665-0028 HE HAS TRIED THAT ROAD AND KNOWS THAT IT IS THE WRONG ROAD
5764-299665-0029 A CHILD CHARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPS IT WITH ITS DIMPLED HAND
5764-299665-0030 THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAS TAUGHT THE CHILD A LESSON
5764-299665-0031 IT IS A RESULT
5764-299665-0032 IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC
5764-299665-0033 WE LIVE TOGETHER IN FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATIONS
5764-299665-0034 THEY ARE PRAISED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED
5764-299665-0035 THEY ARE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT IS TO SAY AS MORAL
5764-299665-0036 THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OR THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MEMBERS
5764-299665-0037 THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAS SAID CONSCIENCE IS BORN OF LOVE
5764-299665-0038 AS PEOPLE ADVANCE THE REMOTE CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED
5764-299665-0039 THE IMAGINATION IS CULTIVATED
5764-299665-0040 A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF ANOTHER
5764-299665-0041 THE SENSE OF DUTY BECOMES STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVE
5764-299665-0042 MAN JUDGES HIMSELF
5764-299665-0043 IN ALL THIS THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0044 MAN HAS DECEIVED HIMSELF
5764-299665-0045 HAS CHRISTIANITY DONE GOOD
5764-299665-0046 WHEN THE CHURCH HAD CONTROL WERE MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER
5764-299665-0047 WHAT HAS RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY OR AUSTRIA
5764-299665-0048 COULD THESE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN WORSE WITHOUT RELIGION
5764-299665-0049 COULD THEY HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY
5764-299665-0050 WHAT DID CHRISTIANITY DO FOR THEM
5764-299665-0051 THEY HATED PLEASURE
5764-299665-0052 THEY MUFFLED ALL THE BELLS OF GLADNESS
5764-299665-0053 THE RELIGION OF THE PURITAN WAS AN UNADULTERATED CURSE
5764-299665-0054 THE PURITAN BELIEVED THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRUEL AND WRETCHED
5764-299665-0055 LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEF IN THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS
5764-299665-0056 THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THEREIN
5764-299665-0057 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC SPIRIT
5764-299665-0058 HAS THE BIBLE MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KIND AND MERCIFUL
5764-299665-0059 RELIGION HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES HAS FAILED
5764-299665-0060 RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCE OF INVESTIGATION AND THOUGHT
5764-299665-0061 RELIGION HAS NEVER MADE MAN FREE
5764-299665-0062 IT HAS NEVER MADE MAN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST
5764-299665-0063 ARE CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE NEARER VIRTUOUS NEARER HONEST THAN SAVAGES
5764-299665-0064 CAN WE CURE DISEASE BY SUPPLICATION
5764-299665-0065 CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUE OR HONOR AS ALMS
5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER WILL LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT THIS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
5764-299665-0067 WE MUST HAVE CORNER STONES
5764-299665-0068 THE STRUCTURE MUST HAVE A BASEMENT
5764-299665-0069 IF WE BUILD WE MUST BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM
5764-299665-0070 I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORNER STONES
5764-299665-0071 THE FIRST STONE IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
5764-299665-0072 IF THESE CORNER STONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM AND TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
5764-299665-0073 IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR
5764-299665-0074 IT FOLLOWS THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DESIGN BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
5764-299665-0075 I SAY WHAT I THINK
5764-299665-0076 EVERY EVENT HAS PARENTS
5764-299665-0077 THAT WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED COULD NOT
5764-299665-0078 IN THE INFINITE CHAIN THERE IS AND THERE CAN BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK
5764-299665-0079 WE NOW KNOW THAT OUR FIRST PARENTS WERE NOT FOREIGNERS
5764-299665-0080 WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
5764-299665-0081 WE KNOW THE PATHS THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELED
5764-299665-0082 WE KNOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF ADVANCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRACED
5764-299665-0083 FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE WORLD
5764-299665-0084 WHY HAVE THE REFORMERS FAILED
5764-299665-0085 THEY DEPEND ON THE LORD ON LUCK AND CHARITY
5764-299665-0086 THEY LIVE BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATH THEIR VICES TO THEIR CHILDREN
5764-299665-0087 FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADEMARK OF NATURE WHY
5764-299665-0088 NATURE PRODUCES WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT THOUGHT
5764-299665-0089 MUST THE WORLD FOREVER REMAIN THE VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSION
5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE BURDENS AND CURSES WHY
5764-299665-0091 PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DEAF
5764-299665-0092 LAW CAN PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME
5764-299665-0093 THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY TALK OR EXAMPLE
5764-299665-0094 THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE QUESTION
5764-299665-0095 THIS FREES WOMAN
5764-299665-0096 POVERTY AND CRIME WILL BE CHILDLESS
5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE FORTS AND BARRICADES OF FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FACE THE FUTURE WITH A SMILE
