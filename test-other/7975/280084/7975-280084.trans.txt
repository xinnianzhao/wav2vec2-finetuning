7975-280084-0000 I URGED ON THE BOYS THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED WE SHOULD NOT SHOOT ANY ONE
7975-280084-0001 WHEN MILLER AND I CROSSED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WERE ON SOME DRY GOODS BOXES AT THE CORNER NEAR THE BANK AND AS SOON AS THEY SAW US WENT RIGHT INTO THE BANK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR US TO GET THERE
7975-280084-0002 WHEN WE CAME UP I TOLD MILLER TO SHUT THE BANK DOOR WHICH THEY HAD LEFT OPEN IN THEIR HURRY
7975-280084-0003 J S ALLEN WHOSE HARDWARE STORE WAS NEAR TRIED TO GO INTO THE BANK BUT MILLER ORDERED HIM AWAY AND HE RAN AROUND THE CORNER SHOUTING
7975-280084-0004 GET YOUR GUNS BOYS THEY'RE ROBBING THE BANK
7975-280084-0005 AND I CALLED TO HIM TO GET INSIDE AT THE SAME TIME FIRING A PISTOL SHOT IN THE AIR AS A SIGNAL TO THE THREE BOYS AT THE BRIDGE THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
7975-280084-0006 ALMOST AT THIS INSTANT I HEARD A PISTOL SHOT IN THE BANK
7975-280084-0007 CHADWELL WOODS AND JIM RODE UP AND JOINED US SHOUTING TO PEOPLE IN THE STREET TO GET INSIDE AND FIRING THEIR PISTOLS TO EMPHASIZE THEIR COMMANDS
7975-280084-0008 IF ANY OF OUR PARTY SHOT HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN WOODS
7975-280084-0009 MEANTIME THE STREET WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY HOT
7975-280084-0010 EVERY TIME I SAW ANY ONE WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DROP OFF MY HORSE AND TRY TO DRIVE THE SHOOTER INSIDE BUT I COULD NOT SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
7975-280084-0011 DOCTOR WHEELER WHO HAD GONE UPSTAIRS IN THE HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DYING IN THE STREET
7975-280084-0012 CHANGING HIS PISTOL TO HIS LEFT HAND BOB RAN OUT AND MOUNTED MILLER'S MARE
7975-280084-0013 WHAT KEPT YOU SO LONG I ASKED PITTS
7975-280084-0014 AS TO THE REST OF THE AFFAIR INSIDE THE BANK I TAKE THE ACCOUNT OF A NORTHFIELD NARRATOR
7975-280084-0015 WHERE'S THE MONEY OUTSIDE THE SAFE BOB ASKED
7975-280084-0016 THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUNKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL PITTS CHASED HIM WITH A BULLET
7975-280084-0017 THE FIRST ONE MISSED HIM BUT THE SECOND WENT THROUGH HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
