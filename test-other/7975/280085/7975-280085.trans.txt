7975-280085-0005 NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS HE RELEASED THAN HE MADE POSTHASTE INTO MANKATO TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER POSSE WAS LOOKING FOR US
7975-280085-0006 THE WHISTLE ON THE OIL MILL BLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS A SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED UPON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED BUT WE WERE NOT MOLESTED
