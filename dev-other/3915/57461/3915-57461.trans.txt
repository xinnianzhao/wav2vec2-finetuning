3915-57461-0000 WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE
3915-57461-0001 TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE
3915-57461-0002 BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADE'S THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF KUANA
3915-57461-0003 HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED IN FERRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELLERS EMBARKED
3915-57461-0004 WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM
3915-57461-0005 WHEN HE SAW THIS THE RONIN FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KIYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPENED TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER
3915-57461-0006 NOW ALAS BY THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE
3915-57461-0007 HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM
3915-57461-0008 THEN THE RONIN SAID TO THE BOATMEN
3915-57461-0009 WHAT THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER TRAVELLERS
3915-57461-0010 THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONIN HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED
3915-57461-0011 WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONIN OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTO
3915-57461-0012 FORTUNE FAVOURING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD
3915-57461-0013 SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THIEF
3915-57461-0014 HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR
3915-57461-0015 AT LENGTH UNDONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATION TOKUBEI FELL ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING OH MISERY MISERY THE WANDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME
3915-57461-0016 NOW IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT STREET
3915-57461-0017 AND HIDING HIS HEAD UNDER THE COVERLET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER
3915-57461-0018 THREE YEARS AGO AT THE KUANA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT
3915-57461-0019 HAPPILY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART
3915-57461-0020 ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF YOUR MARVELLOUS AILMENT
3915-57461-0021 THINKING I COULD DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN
3915-57461-0022 AND WOULD IT NOT ILL BECOME ME TO BEAR MALICE
3915-57461-0023 REPENT THEREFORE AND ABANDON YOUR EVIL WAYS
3915-57461-0024 TO SEE YOU DO SO I SHOULD ESTEEM THE HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS
3915-57461-0025 BE OF GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT I AM REALLY A LIVING MAN AND NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN COME TO TORMENT YOU
3915-57461-0026 IN A FIT OF MADNESS I WAS TEMPTED TO KILL AND ROB YOU
3915-57461-0027 FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GREW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WICKED I HAD BEEN AND THE MORE I FORESAW THAT MY VICTIM'S VENGEANCE WOULD SOME DAY OVERTAKE ME
3915-57461-0028 HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHT I LOST MY NERVE TILL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD YOUR SPIRIT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH FELL ILL
3915-57461-0029 BUT HOW YOU MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND ARE STILL ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
3915-57461-0030 A GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUDDERS AT THE RUSTLING OF THE WIND OR THE CHATTERING OF A STORK'S BEAK A MURDERER'S CONSCIENCE PREYS UPON HIS MIND TILL HE SEES WHAT IS NOT
