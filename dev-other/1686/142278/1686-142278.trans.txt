1686-142278-0000 HE WAS GONE
1686-142278-0001 NO MORE DEEP BLUE SKIES OR CRIMSON AND AMBER TINTS
1686-142278-0002 SHE SAT BY HERSELF AT THE FIRE WITH UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE BEHIND HER THINKING OVER THE DAY THE HAPPY WALK HAPPY SKETCHING CHEERFUL PLEASANT DINNER AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE MISERABLE WALK IN THE GARDEN
1686-142278-0003 HERE WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCT HAD MADE ANYTHING BUT A REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH A REJECTION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIEST PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF BRIEFS SUCCESS AND ALL ITS SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE CLEVER AND AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOLE AVOWED OBJECTS OF HIS DESIRES OH DEAR
1686-142278-0004 HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THIS WHIRL OF THOUGHTS WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER
1686-142278-0005 MISTER HALE SIPPED HIS TEA IN ABSTRACTED SILENCE MARGARET HAD THE RESPONSES ALL TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0006 SHE FORGOT THAT HE HAD NOT MADE THEM AN OFFER
1686-142278-0007 MARGARET WAS PREPARING HER MOTHER'S WORSTED WORK AND RATHER SHRINKING FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE LONG EVENING AND WISHING BED TIME WERE COME THAT SHE MIGHT GO OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AGAIN
1686-142278-0008 MARGARET
1686-142278-0009 I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
1686-142278-0010 VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
1686-142278-0011 MISTER LENNOX HAD NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER FATHER AFTER HER REFUSAL OR ELSE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR
1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT HER FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
1686-142278-0013 MISTER HALE DID NOT ANSWER FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THE SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HER FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0015 BUT WHY DEAR PAPA DO TELL ME
1686-142278-0016 BECAUSE I MUST NO LONGER BE A MINISTER IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
1686-142278-0017 BUT NOTHING TO THE SHOCK SHE RECEIVED FROM MISTER HALE'S LAST SPEECH WHAT COULD HE MEAN
1686-142278-0018 IT WAS ALL THE WORSE FOR BEING SO MYSTERIOUS
1686-142278-0019 WHY CAN YOU NO LONGER BE A CLERGYMAN
1686-142278-0020 SURELY IF THE BISHOP WERE TOLD ALL WE KNOW ABOUT FREDERICK AND THE HARD UNJUST
1686-142278-0021 MARGARET I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT
1686-142278-0022 I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THIS ONCE BUT AFTER TO NIGHT LET US NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN
1686-142278-0023 I CAN MEET THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY PAINFUL MISERABLE DOUBTS BUT IT IS AN EFFORT BEYOND ME TO SPEAK OF WHAT HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH SUFFERING
1686-142278-0024 NO NOT DOUBTS AS TO RELIGION NOT THE SLIGHTEST INJURY TO THAT HE PAUSED
1686-142278-0025 MARGARET SIGHED AS IF STANDING ON THE VERGE OF SOME NEW HORROR
1686-142278-0026 MARGARET HOW I LOVE THE HOLY CHURCH FROM WHICH I AM TO BE SHUT OUT
1686-142278-0027 HE COULD NOT GO ON FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
1686-142278-0028 MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO SAY IT SEEMED TO HER AS TERRIBLY MYSTERIOUS AS IF HER FATHER WERE ABOUT TO TURN MAHOMETAN
1686-142278-0029 THE ONE STAID FOUNDATION OF HER HOME OF HER IDEA OF HER BELOVED FATHER SEEMED REELING AND ROCKING
1686-142278-0030 HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOBS WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN A VOLUME WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER UPON THE COURSE IN WHICH HE WAS NOW EMBARKED
1686-142278-0031 LISTEN DEAR MARGARET SAID HE PUTTING ONE ARM ROUND HER WAIST
1686-142278-0032 WHEN GOD WILL NOT USE THEE IN ONE KIND YET HE WILL IN ANOTHER
1686-142278-0033 IF WHEN THOU ART CHARGED WITH CORRUPTING GOD'S WORSHIP FALSIFYING THY VOWS THOU PRETENDEST A NECESSITY FOR IT IN ORDER TO A CONTINUANCE IN THE MINISTRY
1686-142278-0034 AS HE READ THIS AND GLANCED AT MUCH MORE WHICH HE DID NOT READ HE GAINED RESOLUTION FOR HIMSELF AND FELT AS IF HE TOO COULD BE BRAVE AND FIRM IN DOING WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT BUT AS HE CEASED HE HEARD MARGARET'S LOW CONVULSIVE SOB AND HIS COURAGE SANK DOWN UNDER THE KEEN SENSE OF SUFFERING
1686-142278-0035 I HAVE BORNE LONG WITH SELF REPROACH THAT WOULD HAVE ROUSED ANY MIND LESS TORPID AND COWARDLY THAN MINE
1686-142278-0036 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE WENT ON
1686-142278-0037 MARGARET I TRIED TO DO IT I TRIED TO CONTENT MYSELF WITH SIMPLY REFUSING THE ADDITIONAL PREFERMENT AND STOPPING QUIETLY HERE STRANGLING MY CONSCIENCE NOW AS I HAD STRAINED IT BEFORE
1686-142278-0038 GOD FORGIVE ME
1686-142278-0039 HE ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SPEAKING LOW WORDS OF SELF REPROACH AND HUMILIATION OF WHICH MARGARET WAS THANKFUL TO HEAR BUT FEW
1686-142278-0040 MARGARET I RETURN TO THE OLD SAD BURDEN WE MUST LEAVE HELSTONE
1686-142278-0041 YES
1686-142278-0042 I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE BISHOP I DARE SAY I HAVE TOLD YOU SO BUT I FORGET THINGS JUST NOW SAID MISTER HALE COLLAPSING INTO HIS DEPRESSED MANNER AS SOON AS HE CAME TO TALK OF HARD MATTER OF FACT DETAILS INFORMING HIM OF MY INTENTION TO RESIGN THIS VICARAGE
1686-142278-0043 THEY ARE BUT WHAT I HAVE TRIED UPON MYSELF WITHOUT AVAIL
1686-142278-0044 THAT WILL BE A TRIAL BUT WORSE FAR WORSE WILL BE THE PARTING FROM MY DEAR PEOPLE
1686-142278-0045 HE WILL COME TO STAY WITH US TO MORROW
1686-142278-0046 WAS IT TO BE SO SUDDEN THEN
1686-142278-0047 WHAT DOES MAMMA SAY
1686-142278-0048 MARGARET I AM A POOR COWARD AFTER ALL I CANNOT BEAR TO GIVE PAIN
1686-142278-0049 YES INDEED SHE MUST SAID MARGARET
1686-142278-0050 PERHAPS AFTER ALL SHE MAY NOT OH YES
1686-142278-0051 SHE WILL SHE MUST BE SHOCKED' AS THE FORCE OF THE BLOW RETURNED UPON HERSELF IN TRYING TO REALISE HOW ANOTHER WOULD TAKE IT
1686-142278-0052 TO MILTON NORTHERN HE ANSWERED WITH A DULL INDIFFERENCE FOR HE HAD PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVE HAD MADE HER CLING TO HIM AND FOR A MOMENT STRIVE TO SOOTHE HIM WITH HER LOVE YET THE KEENNESS OF THE PAIN WAS AS FRESH AS EVER IN HER MIND
1686-142278-0053 MILTON NORTHERN
1686-142278-0054 YES SAID HE IN THE SAME DESPONDENT INDIFFERENT WAY
1686-142278-0055 BUT HE WITH HIS QUICK INTUITIVE SYMPATHY READ IN HER FACE AS IN A MIRROR THE REFLECTIONS OF HIS OWN MOODY DEPRESSION AND TURNED IT OFF WITH AN EFFORT
1686-142278-0056 YOU SHALL BE TOLD ALL MARGARET
1686-142278-0057 ONLY HELP ME TO TELL YOUR MOTHER
1686-142278-0058 I AM GOING OUT FOR THE DAY TO BID FARMER DOBSON AND THE POOR PEOPLE ON BRACY COMMON GOOD BYE
1686-142278-0059 WOULD YOU DISLIKE BREAKING IT TO HER VERY MUCH MARGARET
1686-142278-0060 MARGARET DID DISLIKE IT DID SHRINK FROM IT MORE THAN FROM ANYTHING SHE HAD EVER HAD TO DO IN HER LIFE BEFORE
1686-142278-0061 MISTER HALE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDINGLY HE PRESSED HER HAND IN TOKEN OF GRATITUDE
1686-142278-0062 MARGARET WAS NEARLY UPSET AGAIN INTO A BURST OF CRYING
1686-142278-0063 TO TURN HER THOUGHTS SHE SAID NOW TELL ME PAPA WHAT OUR PLANS ARE

1686-142278-0070 I CAN ALWAYS DECIDE BETTER BY MYSELF AND NOT INFLUENCED BY THOSE WHOM I LOVE SAID HE AS A HALF APOLOGY FOR HAVING ARRANGED SO MUCH BEFORE HE HAD TOLD ANY ONE OF HIS FAMILY OF HIS INTENTIONS
1686-142278-0071 I CANNOT STAND OBJECTIONS
1686-142278-0072 THEY MAKE ME SO UNDECIDED
1686-142278-0073 MISTER HALE CONTINUED A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN MY MISERY OF DOUBT BECAME MORE THAN I COULD BEAR WITHOUT SPEAKING I WROTE TO MISTER BELL YOU REMEMBER MISTER BELL MARGARET

1686-142278-0076 I DON'T KNOW THAT HE GAVE ME MUCH STRENGTH
1686-142278-0077 A PRIVATE TUTOR
1686-142278-0078 SAID MARGARET LOOKING SCORNFUL WHAT IN THE WORLD DO MANUFACTURERS WANT WITH THE CLASSICS OR LITERATURE OR THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A GENTLEMAN
1686-142278-0079 OH SAID HER FATHER SOME OF THEM REALLY SEEM TO BE FINE FELLOWS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR OWN DEFICIENCIES WHICH IS MORE THAN MANY A MAN AT OXFORD IS

1686-142278-0081 AND IN MILTON MARGARET I SHALL FIND A BUSY LIFE IF NOT A HAPPY ONE AND PEOPLE AND SCENES SO DIFFERENT THAT I SHALL NEVER BE REMINDED OF HELSTONE
