700-122868-0000 OF COURSE YOU MUST BE ELAINE ANNE SAID DIANA
700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEDED JANE ANDREWS BUT I KNOW I COULDN'T KEEP STILL
700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A REDHEADED ELAINE MOURNED ANNE
700-122868-0003 AND ELAINE WAS THE LILY MAID
700-122868-0004 YOUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RUBY'S SAID DIANA EARNESTLY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT
700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR TROUT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LEARNED TO ROW THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOMED DORY MISTER BARRY KEPT FOR DUCK SHOOTING
700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANNE'S IDEA THAT THEY DRAMATIZE ELAINE
700-122868-0007 THOSE DAYS SHE SAID WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THE PRESENT
700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING ELAINE
700-122868-0009 THE BLACK SHAWL HAVING BEEN PROCURED ANNE SPREAD IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST
700-122868-0010 IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS IS HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS LYNDE WAS BORN
700-122868-0011 JANE YOU ARRANGE THIS
700-122868-0012 IT'S SILLY FOR ELAINE TO BE TALKING WHEN SHE'S DEAD
700-122868-0013 JANE ROSE TO THE OCCASION
700-122868-0014 LEFT BEHIND AT THE LANDING
700-122868-0015 ANNE GAVE ONE GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION
700-122868-0016 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE JUST ONE
700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLOWERY PRAYER
700-122868-0018 THE FLAT DRIFTED UNDER THE BRIDGE AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MIDSTREAM
700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING IT ON THE LOWER HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NOT A DOUBT BUT THAT ANNE HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY EACH SEEMING AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILY MAID
700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY COME WHERE HAD THE GIRLS GONE
700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SUGGEST ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME POSSIBILITIES TO HER
700-122868-0023 ANNE SHIRLEY
700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH DID YOU GET THERE HE EXCLAIMED
700-122868-0025 IT WAS CERTAINLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE DIGNIFIED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
700-122868-0026 WHAT HAS HAPPENED ANNE
700-122868-0027 ASKED GILBERT TAKING UP HIS OARS
700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING ELAINE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUER AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELOT IN THE BARGE I MEAN THE FLAT
700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT ANNE HESITATED
700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK QUEER LITTLE BEAT
700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AND OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS IN NO WHIT ALLAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GILBERT BLYTHE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
700-122868-0033 ALL RIGHT
700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN ANNE SHIRLEY AND I DON'T CARE EITHER
700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TERRIBLY BUT STILL
700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIENDS INTO A SCRAPE
700-122868-0037 ANNE'S PRESENTIMENT PROVED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PRESENTIMENTS ARE APT TO DO
700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE ANNE GROANED MARILLA
700-122868-0039 I DON'T SEE HOW SAID MARILLA
700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING MISTAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS HELPED TO CURE ME OF SOME GREAT SHORTCOMING
