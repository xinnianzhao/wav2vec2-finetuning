4153-186222-0000 THERE'S LITTLE DANGER IN THIS QUARTER I'M SURE SO I MAY AS WELL BE FRIENDS WITH THE POOR CHILD
4153-186222-0001 AH WHY NOT
4153-186222-0002 BETH HESITATED
4153-186222-0003 THE LETTER ASKING ME TO VISIT HER WAS THE FIRST I HAVE EVER RECEIVED FROM HER
4153-186222-0004 BUT SINCE SHE ASKED ME TO VISIT HER WE JUDGED SHE HAD SOFTENED AND MIGHT WISH TO BECOME FRIENDLY AND SO I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION
4153-186222-0005 SURELY TWO GIRLS WILL HAVE A BETTER TIME IN THIS LONELY OLD PLACE THAN ONE COULD HAVE ALONE
4153-186222-0006 OH YES SHE HAS CORRECTED LOUISE
4153-186222-0007 YOU MEAN PATRICIA DOYLE YES
4153-186222-0008 THEN WE MAY CONCLUDE SHE'S LEFT OUT OF THE ARRANGEMENT SAID BETH CALMLY
4153-186222-0009 YOU'LL FIGHT FOR YOUR CHANCE AND FIGHT MIGHTY HARD
4153-186222-0010 WHY MY DEAR COUSIN I DON'T WANT AUNT JANE'S MONEY
4153-186222-0011 MY MOTHER AND I ARE AMPLY PROVIDED FOR AND I AM ONLY HERE TO FIND REST FROM MY SOCIAL DUTIES AND TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH MY DEAD FATHER'S SISTER THAT IS ALL
4153-186222-0012 MY FATHER TEACHES MUSIC AND MOTHER SCOLDS HIM CONTINUALLY FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP OUT OF DEBT
4153-186222-0013 WE'VE NEVER SEEN A CENT OF HER MONEY ALTHOUGH FATHER HAS TRIED AT TIMES TO BORROW ENOUGH TO HELP HIM OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES
4153-186222-0014 I EVEN KISSED HER WHEN SHE ASKED ME TO AND IT SENT A SHIVER ALL DOWN MY BACK
4153-186222-0015 FOR MY PART I AM FOND OF EVERYONE AND IT DELIGHTS ME TO FUSS AROUND INVALIDS AND ASSIST THEM
4153-186222-0016 YOU SAY YOU LIKE TO CARE FOR INVALIDS AND I DON'T
4153-186222-0017 YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME THINK YOU DON'T WANT ELMHURST WHEN YOU'RE AS ANXIOUS TO GET IT AS I AM
4153-186222-0018 THEY CALL ME BETH SULLENLY
4153-186222-0019 I COULDN'T LIVE IN THIS OUT OF THE WAY CORNER OF THE WORLD YOU KNOW
4153-186222-0020 BUT SUPPOSE SHE LEAVES IT TO YOU PERSISTED BETH
4153-186222-0021 LOUISE SEEMED TO MEDITATE
4153-186222-0022 IT'S A MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID BETH LOOKING AT HER COUSIN DOUBTFULLY
4153-186222-0023 NOW SHALL WE BE FRIENDS SHE ASKED LIGHTLY
4153-186222-0024 TO BE SURE I SHOULD WANT YOU TO MY DEAR
4153-186222-0025 SUCH A GIRL FRIEND IT HAD NEVER BEEN HER PRIVILEGE TO HAVE BEFORE AND WHEN HER SUSPICIONS WERE FORGOTTEN SHE BECAME FAIRLY RESPONSIVE AND BRIGHTENED WONDERFULLY
4153-186222-0026 SILAS SHE SAID WHEN HE ENTERED WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY NIECES
4153-186222-0027 THEY ARE VERY CHARMING GIRLS HE ANSWERED ALTHOUGH THEY ARE AT AN AGE WHEN FEW GIRLS SHOW TO GOOD ADVANTAGE
4153-186222-0028 WHY DID YOU NOT INVITE KENNETH TO DINNER JANE THE BOY
4153-186222-0029 HE IS CONSTANTLY SAYING DISAGREEABLE THINGS
4153-186222-0030 VERY WELL SAID THE LAWYER QUIETLY WHICH OF MY NIECES DO YOU PREFER
4153-186222-0031 ASKED THE OLD LADY AFTER A PAUSE I CANNOT SAY ON SO SHORT AN ACQUAINTANCE HE ANSWERED WITH GRAVITY WHICH DO YOU PREFER JANE
4153-186222-0032 THEY ARE EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY SHE ANSWERED
4153-186222-0033 I CANNOT IMAGINE ELMHURST BELONGING TO EITHER SILAS
4153-186222-0034 I MUST SEE THAT OTHER NIECE THE ONE WHO DEFIES ME AND REFUSES TO ANSWER MY SECOND LETTER
4153-186222-0035 THERE WOULD BE A DOZEN HEIRS TO FIGHT FOR MY MONEY AND DEAR OLD ELMHURST WOULD BE SOLD TO STRANGERS SHE RESUMED WITH BITTERNESS
