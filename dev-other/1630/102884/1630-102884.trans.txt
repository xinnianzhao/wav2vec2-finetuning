1630-102884-0000 IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I HAVE FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST
1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS
1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE WEST
1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MORAL RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THEY ACQUIRED A TRUE LOVE OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT EPIC OF THE SOUL OF OUR PEOPLE THE MAHABHARATA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY WAS STIRRED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HARDENED INTO AN AGE OF INERT CONSTRUCTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ORDER WHICH PROVED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND ARE IN HARMONY WITH OUR VITAL FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 BY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GRIP OF AN INELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HOLDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LAWS OF LIFE AND GROWTH
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING SOULS INTO A PERMANENT PASSIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOULDING CIRCUMSTANCE TO THEIR OWN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MASTERING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALISE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING OUR STEPS FOR AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY ANOTHER ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY WILL BE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND OF FIGHTING IN FREEDOM'S CAUSE
1630-102884-0016 IT REPRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF INERTIA WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUTH AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO SLAVERY BOTH WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES AND OUTSIDE
