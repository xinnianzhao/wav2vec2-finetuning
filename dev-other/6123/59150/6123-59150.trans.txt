6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL IN EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
6123-59150-0001 IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG
6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF TORTURE
6123-59150-0003 CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0004 HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL AUTHOR
6123-59150-0005 BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT
6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE LUST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LUST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
6123-59150-0007 DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SIN OF NEKHLUDOV IN RESURRECTION
6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIES SOME ONE IN THE IDIOT
6123-59150-0009 ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION
6123-59150-0010 EVEN THE TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS
6123-59150-0011 HE SOWS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SACK
6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THOSE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS EVERYMAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY
6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ANNA KARENINA OR FATHERS AND SONS
6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME
6123-59150-0017 HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION
6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTIST AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO
6123-59150-0019 HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES
6123-59150-0020 WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CATS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACS
6123-59150-0022 SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY
6123-59150-0023 IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM
6123-59150-0024 IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR
6123-59150-0025 NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENT UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
6123-59150-0026 DOSTOEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE
6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL EPANCHIN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETA PROKOFYEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RADOMSKY PRINCESS BYELOKONSKY AGLAIA PRINCE MYSHKIN KOLYA IVOLGIN IPPOLIT VARYA FERDYSHCHENKO NASTASYA FILIPPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA PTITSYN AND GENERAL IVOLGIN
6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS
6123-59150-0029 MISTER MURRY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS THE DEFINITION
6123-59150-0030 TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS
6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW
6123-59150-0033 BECAUSE THEY ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0034 THIS IS ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE
6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRITUAL CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR
6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN SETEBOS
6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF
6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION
6123-59150-0039 OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MYSHKIN IN THE IDIOT
6123-59150-0040 HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT
6123-59150-0041 THE NOVELS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN
6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VOGUEE DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS
6123-59150-0045 THAT IS THE PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS
6123-59150-0046 IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS
