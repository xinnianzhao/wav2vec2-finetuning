7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY THUCYDIDES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS ONE OF HIS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURES THE READER THAT THE HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC AND HINTS WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING GRATULATION WITH WHICH A GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO REGALE A FAVORITE THAT THIS PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY
7601-291468-0001 SUCH ARE THE TRUE SUBJECTS FOR THE HISTORIC PEN
7601-291468-0002 THE FALL OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATION OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES SMOKING IN THEIR RUINS THE PROUDEST WORKS OF ART TUMBLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS ASCENDING UNTO HEAVEN
7601-291468-0003 THUS THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECRATED AS USELESS VERMIN ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EVIDENTLY MADE TO DEVOUR FLIES
7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES IN WHICH HE HAD MADE CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK NOUNS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF RICH BOOTY IN ANCIENT SAWS AND APOPHTHEGMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANGUES AS A TRIUMPHANT GENERAL OF YORE HIS SPOLIA OPIMA
7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED GRATIS
7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED AT A BOWERY OR COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET SOON ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKE JACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK THEM DUTCH OVENS THAT ROASTED MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS THAT WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WEATHERCOCKS THAT TURNED AGAINST THE WIND AND OTHER WRONG HEADED CONTRIVANCES THAT ASTONISHED AND CONFOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS
7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN SWIMMING HE WHO FLOUNDERS AND SPLASHES ON THE SURFACE MAKES MORE NOISE AND ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION THAN THE PEARL DIVER WHO QUIETLY DIVES IN QUEST OF TREASURES TO THE BOTTOM
