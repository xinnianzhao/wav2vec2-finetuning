1650-173551-0000 HIS MAJOR DOMO CAME IN A SECOND TIME TO SAY THAT THE FRENCHMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT THE LETTER FROM THE COUNTESS WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM IF ONLY FOR A MINUTE AND THAT SOMEONE FROM BAZDEEV'S WIDOW HAD CALLED TO ASK PIERRE TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER HUSBAND'S BOOKS AS SHE HERSELF WAS LEAVING FOR THE COUNTRY
1650-173551-0001 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE PASSAGE
1650-173551-0002 THE HALL PORTER WAS STANDING AT THE FRONT DOOR
1650-173551-0003 FROM THE LANDING WHERE PIERRE STOOD THERE WAS A SECOND STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE BACK ENTRANCE
1650-173551-0004 HE WENT DOWN THAT STAIRCASE AND OUT INTO THE YARD NO ONE HAD SEEN HIM
1650-173551-0005 WHEN HE FELT HE WAS BEING LOOKED AT HE BEHAVED LIKE AN OSTRICH WHICH HIDES ITS HEAD IN A BUSH IN ORDER NOT TO BE SEEN HE HUNG HIS HEAD AND QUICKENING HIS PACE WENT DOWN THE STREET
1650-173551-0006 HE HIRED THE FIRST CAB HE MET AND TOLD THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE PATRIARCH'S PONDS WHERE THE WIDOW BAZDEEV'S HOUSE WAS
1650-173551-0007 THIS WAS THE AUTHENTIC SCOTCH ACTS WITH BAZDEEV'S NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS
1650-173551-0008 HE SAT DOWN AT THE DUSTY WRITING TABLE AND HAVING LAID THE MANUSCRIPTS BEFORE HIM OPENED THEM OUT CLOSED THEM FINALLY PUSHED THEM AWAY AND RESTING HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND SANK INTO MEDITATION
1650-173551-0009 MAKAR ALEXEEVICH CAME TWICE THAT EVENING SHUFFLING ALONG IN HIS GALOSHES AS FAR AS THE DOOR AND STOPPED AND LOOKED INGRATIATINGLY AT PIERRE
