6841-88291-0000 BUT SINCE THERE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED DUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DROPPED BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH
6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GAIT AMONG APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDLETS I RECALL A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LYING BEFORE DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASES EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLOWING OF CATTLE IN THE CORRALS
6841-88291-0002 SEEMINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S HOWL BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE REMUDA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAY HERD FROM THE CORRALS TO GOOD FEED THREE BRANDING CREWS WERE TOLD TO BRAND THE CALVES WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK UP ABOUT HALF THE MEN
6841-88291-0004 THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SHORT DRIVE IN THE SALT GRASS
6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO DID GO AFOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CORRALS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT
6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASEWOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILDING A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WIDE GATE AND ENTERED
6841-88291-0008 ONE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A SHEAF OF LONG J H STAMPING IRONS IN HIS HAND
6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE FENCE SMOKING CIGARETTES AND CHATTING TOGETHER
6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SLANTED ACROSS IN ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODEN AND OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE
6841-88291-0012 AS THE LOOP SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH
6841-88291-0013 HOMER WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE OR THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SAT OVER IN ONE STIRRUP TO AVOID THE TIGHTENED LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
6841-88291-0014 NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CALF
6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED
6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULL DOGGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNCED UPON THE VICTIM
6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLOPPED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
6841-88291-0018 THUS THE CALF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIB OR TWO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS UNNECESSARILY ROUGH
6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON YELLED ONE OF THE BULL DOGGERS
6841-88291-0021 MARKER YELLED THE OTHER
6841-88291-0022 THE BRANDER PRESSED THE IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CALF BLATTED A LITTLE AS THE HEAT SCORCHED
6841-88291-0024 THE BRAND SHOWED CHERRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOUR TO INDICATE DUE PEELING AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
6841-88291-0025 THEN HE NICKED OUT A SWALLOW TAIL IN THE OTHER
6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDLE IS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANDING
6841-88291-0027 UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS TO SOME EXTENT PAINFUL AND COULD SOME OTHER METHOD OF READY IDENTIFICATION BE DEVISED IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO ADOPT IT IN PREFERENCE
6841-88291-0028 INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER FOLLOWED THE SPREAD OF THIS DOCTRINE THROUGH ARIZONA
6841-88291-0029 IMAGINE A PUNCHER DESCENDING TO EXAMINE POLITELY THE EAR TAGS OF WILD CATTLE ON THE OPEN RANGE OR IN A ROUND UP
6841-88291-0030 A CALF USUALLY BELLOWS WHEN THE IRON BITES BUT AS SOON AS RELEASED HE ALMOST INVARIABLY GOES TO FEEDING OR TO LOOKING IDLY ABOUT
6841-88291-0031 BESIDES WHICH IT HAPPENS BUT ONCE IN A LIFETIME AND IS OVER IN TEN SECONDS A COMFORT DENIED TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE OUR TEETH FILLED
6841-88291-0032 ONE OF THE LITTLE ANIMALS WAS BUT A FEW MONTHS OLD SO THE RIDER DID NOT BOTHER WITH ITS HIND LEGS BUT TOSSED HIS LOOP OVER ITS NECK
6841-88291-0033 MISTER FROST'S BULL CALF ALONE IN PICTORIAL HISTORY SHOWS THE ATTITUDES
6841-88291-0034 AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE GORGEOUS CONTRAST BETWEEN ALL THIS FRANTIC AND UNCOMPREHENDING EXCITEMENT AND THE ABSOLUTE MATTER OF FACT IMPERTURBABILITY OF HORSE AND RIDER
6841-88291-0035 AS HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS THE CALF WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BEAST WENT OVER PROMPTLY BIT THE GROUND WITH A WHACK AND WAS POUNCED UPON AND HELD
6841-88291-0036 HE WOULD CATCH HIMSELF ON ONE FOOT SCRAMBLE VIGOROUSLY AND END BY STRUGGLING BACK TO THE UPRIGHT
6841-88291-0037 YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
6841-88291-0038 THIS IS PRODUCTIVE OF SOME FUN IF IT FAILS
6841-88291-0039 BY NOW THE BRANDING WAS IN FULL SWING
6841-88291-0040 WHEN THE NOOSES FELL THEY TURNED AND WALKED TOWARD THE FIRE AS A MATTER OF COURSE RARELY DID THE CAST FAIL
6841-88291-0041 MEN RAN TO AND FRO BUSY AND INTENT
6841-88291-0042 SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR CALVES WERE ON THE GROUND AT ONCE
6841-88291-0043 DUST EDDIED AND DISSIPATED
6841-88291-0044 NO MORE NECKED CALVES THEY ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0045 THEN HE WOULD SPIT ON HIS HANDS AND GO AT IT ALONE
6841-88291-0046 IF LUCK ATTENDED HIS FIRST EFFORT HIS SARCASM WAS PROFOUND THERE'S YORE LITTLE CALF SAID HE
6841-88291-0047 WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TOTE IT TO YOU OR DO YOU RECKON YOU COULD TODDLE THIS FAR WITH YORE LITTLE OLD IRON
6841-88291-0048 TOWARD NOON THE WORK SLACKED
6841-88291-0049 FINALLY HOMER RODE OVER TO THE CATTLEMAN AND REPORTED THE BRANDING FINISHED
6841-88291-0050 THE LATTER COUNTED THE MARKS IN HIS TALLY BOOK
6841-88291-0051 ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX HE ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0052 THE MARKERS SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS TOLD OVER THE BITS OF EARS THEY HAD SAVED
6841-88291-0053 THE TOTAL AMOUNTED TO BUT AN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
6841-88291-0054 FINALLY WOODEN DISCOVERED IT IN HIS HIP POCKET
6841-88291-0055 THEY HAD BEEN DOING A WRESTLER'S HEAVY WORK ALL THE MORNING BUT DID NOT SEEM TO BE TIRED
6841-88291-0056 I SAW ONCE IN SOME CRANK PHYSICAL CULTURE PERIODICAL THAT A COWBOY'S LIFE WAS PHYSICALLY ILL BALANCED LIKE AN OARSMAN'S IN THAT IT EXERCISED ONLY CERTAIN MUSCLES OF THE BODY
