6455-67804-0000 I ACCOMPANY MY GRANDDAUGHTER TO THIS THIS ENTERTAINMENT HER LADYSHIP RESPONDED
6455-67804-0001 IT IS SCARCELY A JOYOUS OCCASION TO MY MIND
6455-67804-0002 NO NEED TO DRESS YOURSELF LIKE THAT IF IT ISN'T EJACULATED MISTER BINNIE
6455-67804-0003 IF I WERE SURE THIS WAS THE SAME MAN I'D GO MYSELF
6455-67804-0004 WHEN I FIND A FELLOW WHO'S NEITHER KNAVE NOR FOOL I STICK TO HIM BELIEVE I'LL SEND TO FIND OUT
6455-67804-0005 THE ONLY TIME HE HAD MADE ANY COMMENT UPON HER WAS THE FIRST TIME HE SAW HER IN THE DRESS SHE HAD COPIED FROM OCTAVIA'S NICE GOWN THAT HE BLURTED OUT DIDN'T GET IT HERE I'LL WAGER
6455-67804-0006 DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT HE SAID GRUFFLY

6455-67804-0008 I SHALL NOT BE AFRAID AGAIN
6455-67804-0009 IN FACT SHE HAD PERFECTLY CONFOUNDED HER LADYSHIP BY HER DEMEANOR
6455-67804-0010 I BEG YOU WILL NOT SPEAK TO ME OF THAT AGAIN SHE SAID I WILL NOT LISTEN
6455-67804-0011 AND TURNING ABOUT SHE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM
6455-67804-0012 AND NOTHING MORE HAD BEEN SAID ON THE SUBJECT SINCE
6455-67804-0013 BEFORE BREAKFAST MISS BELINDA WAS STARTLED BY THE ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER TELEGRAM WHICH RAN AS FOLLOWS

6455-67804-0021 SHE WAS ENJOYING HERSELF MISTER FRANCIS BAROLD OBSERVED IT RATHER GLOOMILY AS HE STOOD APART
6455-67804-0022 AND THEN HAD COME LORD LANSDOWNE WHO IN CROSSING THE LAWN TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIS HOST HAD BEEN OBSERVED TO KEEP HIS EYE FIXED UPON ONE PARTICULAR POINT BURMISTONE HE SAID AFTER HAVING SPOKEN HIS FIRST WORDS WHO IS THAT TALL GIRL IN WHITE
6455-67804-0023 AND IN TEN MINUTES LADY THEOBALD MISSUS BURNHAM MISTER BAROLD AND DIVERS OTHERS TOO NUMEROUS TO MENTION SAW HIM STANDING AT OCTAVIA'S SIDE EVIDENTLY WITH NO INTENTION OF LEAVING IT
6455-67804-0024 NOT LONG AFTER THIS FRANCIS BAROLD FOUND HIS WAY TO MISS BELINDA WHO WAS VERY BUSY AND RATHER NERVOUS YOUR NIECE IS EVIDENTLY ENJOYING HERSELF HE REMARKED
6455-67804-0025 OCTAVIA IS MOST HAPPY TO DAY ANSWERED MISS BELINDA
6455-67804-0026 VERY FEW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND OCTAVIA SAID MISS BELINDA I'M NOT SURE THAT I FOLLOW ALL HER MOODS MYSELF
6455-67804-0027 SHE IS NOT AS FRIVOLOUS AS SHE APPEARS TO THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW HER WELL
6455-67804-0028 BAROLD STOOD GNAWING HIS MUSTACHE AND MADE NO REPLY HE WAS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE
6455-67804-0029 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY FATE AND RATHER WISHED HE HAD RETURNED TO LONDON FROM BROADOAKS INSTEAD OF LOITERING IN SLOWBRIDGE
6455-67804-0030 HE HAD AMUSED HIMSELF AT FIRST BUT IN TIME HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED TO FIND HIS AMUSEMENT LOSE SOMETHING OF ITS ZEST
6455-67804-0031 IT'S DEUCEDLY BAD FORM ON HIS PART HE SAID MENTALLY WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY IT
6455-67804-0032 OCTAVIA ON THE CONTRARY DID NOT ASK WHAT HE MEANT BY IT
6455-67804-0033 WHERE HE EJACULATED I SAY WHAT A NAME
6455-67804-0034 I HAD NOT OBSERVED IT ANSWERED HER LADYSHIP
6455-67804-0035 BUT SHE GLARED AT BAROLD AS HE PASSED AND BECKONED TO HIM WHERE IS LUCIA SHE DEMANDED
6455-67804-0036 I SAW HER WITH BURMISTONE HALF AN HOUR AGO HE ANSWERED COLDLY HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR MY MOTHER I SHALL RETURN TO LONDON TO MORROW LEAVING HERE EARLY SHE TURNED QUITE PALE
6455-67804-0037 WHAT HAS HAPPENED SHE ASKED RIGIDLY HE LOOKED SLIGHTLY SURPRISED NOTHING WHATEVER HE REPLIED
6455-67804-0038 I HAVE REMAINED HERE LONGER THAN I INTENDED
6455-67804-0039 SHE BEGAN TO MOVE THE MANACLES ON HER RIGHT WRIST
6455-67804-0040 SHE HAD NOT BROUGHT LUCIA UP UNDER HER OWN EYE FOR NOTHING
