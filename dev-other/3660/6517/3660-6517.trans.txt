3660-6517-0000 THE DATES SEEM UNIMPORTANT BUT THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE SHIP HAVE BEEN UNREMITTINGLY BUSY
3660-6517-0001 BOWERS ATTACKED THE SHIP'S STORES SURVEYED RELISTED AND RESTOWED THEM SAVING VERY MUCH SPACE BY UNSTOWING NUMEROUS CASES AND STOWING THE CONTENTS IN THE LAZARETTE
3660-6517-0002 WITHOUT STEAM THE LEAK CAN NOW BE KEPT UNDER WITH THE HAND PUMP BY TWO DAILY EFFORTS OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO TWENTY MINUTES
3660-6517-0003 AS THE SHIP WAS AND IN HER PRESENT HEAVILY LADEN CONDITION IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN THREE TO FOUR HOURS EACH DAY
3660-6517-0004 THE LARGE GREEN TENT WAS PUT UP AND PROPER SUPPORTS MADE FOR IT
3660-6517-0005 THE ENGINE ROOM STAFF AND ANDERSON'S PEOPLE ON THE ENGINES SCIENTISTS WERE STOWING THEIR LABORATORIES THE COOK REFITTING HIS GALLEY AND SO FORTH NOT A SINGLE SPOT BUT HAD ITS BAND OF WORKERS
3660-6517-0006 THE MEN'S SPACE SUCH AS IT IS THEREFORE EXTENDS FROM THE FORE HATCH TO THE STEM ON THE MAIN DECK
3660-6517-0007 UNDER THE FORECASTLE ARE STALLS FOR FIFTEEN PONIES THE MAXIMUM THE SPACE WOULD HOLD THE NARROW IRREGULAR SPACE IN FRONT IS PACKED TIGHT WITH FODDER
3660-6517-0008 IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE FORECASTLE BULKHEAD IS THE SMALL BOOBY HATCH THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THE MEN'S MESS DECK IN BAD WEATHER
3660-6517-0009 ABAFT THE FORE HATCH IS THE ICE HOUSE
3660-6517-0010 WE MANAGED TO GET THREE TONS OF ICE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO CARCASES OF MUTTON AND THREE CARCASES OF BEEF BESIDES SOME BOXES OF SWEETBREADS AND KIDNEYS INTO THIS SPACE
3660-6517-0011 THE SACKS CONTAINING THIS LAST ADDED TO THE GOODS ALREADY MENTIONED MAKE A REALLY HEAVY DECK CARGO AND ONE IS NATURALLY ANXIOUS CONCERNING IT BUT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY LASHING AND SECURING HAS BEEN DONE
3660-6517-0012 FORAGE I ORIGINALLY ORDERED THIRTY TONS OF COMPRESSED OATEN HAY FROM MELBOURNE
3660-6517-0013 THE SCENE IS WHOLLY ENCHANTING AND SUCH A VIEW FROM SOME SHELTERED SUNNY CORNER IN A GARDEN WHICH BLAZES WITH MASSES OF RED AND GOLDEN FLOWERS TENDS TO FEELINGS OF INEXPRESSIBLE SATISFACTION WITH ALL THINGS
3660-6517-0014 A GREAT MASS OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED
3660-6517-0015 K AND I LUNCHED WITH A PARTY IN THE NEW ZEALAND COMPANY'S SHIP RUAPEHU
3660-6517-0016 TELEGRAM TO SAY TERRA NOVA HAD ARRIVED SUNDAY NIGHT
3660-6517-0017 A THIRD SLEDGE STANDS ACROSS THE BREAK OF THE POOP IN THE SPACE HITHERTO OCCUPIED BY THE AFTER WINCH
3660-6517-0018 THE QUANTITY IS TWO AND A HALF TONS AND THE SPACE OCCUPIED CONSIDERABLE
3660-6517-0019 THE SHIP WAS OVER TWO FEET BY THE STERN BUT THIS WILL SOON BE REMEDIED
3660-6517-0020 THEY MUST PERFORCE BE CHAINED UP AND THEY ARE GIVEN WHAT SHELTER IS AFFORDED ON DECK BUT THEIR POSITION IS NOT ENVIABLE
3660-6517-0021 IT IS A PATHETIC ATTITUDE DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT OF COLD AND MISERY OCCASIONALLY SOME POOR BEAST EMITS A LONG PATHETIC WHINE
3660-6517-0022 THERE ARE GENERALLY ONE OR TWO ON WATCH WHICH EASES MATTERS BUT IT IS A SQUASH
3660-6517-0023 LATER IN THE DAY THE WIND HAS VEERED TO THE WESTWARD HEADING US SLIGHTLY
3660-6517-0024 OATES AND ATKINSON WITH INTERMITTENT ASSISTANCE FROM OTHERS WERE BUSY KEEPING THE PONIES ON THEIR LEGS
3660-6517-0025 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GRAPPLE WITH THE EVIL AND NEARLY ALL HANDS WERE LABOURING FOR HOURS IN THE WAIST OF THE SHIP HEAVING COAL SACKS OVERBOARD AND RE LASHING THE PETROL CASES ET CETERA IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE UNDER SUCH DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES
3660-6517-0026 NO SOONER WAS SOME SEMBLANCE OF ORDER RESTORED THAN SOME EXCEPTIONALLY HEAVY WAVE WOULD TEAR AWAY THE LASHING AND THE WORK HAD TO BE DONE ALL OVER AGAIN
3660-6517-0027 FROM THIS MOMENT ABOUT FOUR A M THE ENGINE ROOM BECAME THE CENTRE OF INTEREST
3660-6517-0028 THE WATER GAINED IN SPITE OF EVERY EFFORT
3660-6517-0029 THE OUTLOOK APPEARED GRIM
3660-6517-0030 THE AMOUNT OF WATER WHICH WAS BEING MADE WITH THE SHIP SO ROUGHLY HANDLED WAS MOST UNCERTAIN
3660-6517-0031 WILLIAMS HAD TO CONFESS HE WAS BEATEN AND MUST DRAW FIRES WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
3660-6517-0032 THE BILGE PUMP IS DEPENDENT ON THE MAIN ENGINE
3660-6517-0033 ON ONE OCCASION I WAS WAIST DEEP WHEN STANDING ON THE RAIL OF THE POOP
3660-6517-0034 THE AFTERGUARD WERE ORGANISED IN TWO PARTIES BY EVANS TO WORK BUCKETS THE MEN WERE KEPT STEADILY GOING ON THE CHOKED HAND PUMPS THIS SEEMED ALL THAT COULD BE DONE FOR THE MOMENT AND WHAT A MEASURE TO COUNT AS THE SOLE SAFEGUARD OF THE SHIP FROM SINKING PRACTICALLY AN ATTEMPT TO BALE HER OUT
3660-6517-0035 OCCASIONALLY A HEAVY SEA WOULD BEAR ONE OF THEM AWAY AND HE WAS ONLY SAVED BY HIS CHAIN
